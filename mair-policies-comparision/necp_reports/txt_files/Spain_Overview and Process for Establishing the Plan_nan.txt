1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 11 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY According to the study conducted, the measures provided for in the INECP will allow the following results to be achieved in 2030:    23% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 19901;   42% share of renewables in energy end-use;   39.5% improvement in energy efficiency;   74% share of renewable energy in electricity generation. These results will enable progress to be made towards the longer-term objective that has guided the preparation of this Plan, namely to achieve GHG emission neutrality in Spain by 2050, in line with the positions adopted by the European Commission and the majority of Member States. This objective represents a reduction of at least 90% in total gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 compared to 1990. In addition, the aim is to achieve a 100% renewable electricity system by the same date.  Decarbonisation of the economy and progress in renewable energy  The long-term goal that guided the preparation of the Plan is to make Spain carbon neutral by 2050. To that end, the medium-term objective of the Plan is to achieve a reduction in emissions of at least 20% in 2030 compared to 1990. According to the forecast made in the Plan, the measures that it includes will achieve a 23% reduction in emissions. The non-ETS sectors (residential, transport, agriculture, waste, fluorinated gases and industry not subject to emissions trading) will contribute to achieving this target with a 39% reduction by 2030 compared to the levels in 2005, while the sectors subject to emissions trading will contribute with a decrease of 61% compared to 2005.  The path established for the achievement of the objectives set for 2030 is based on the principles of technological neutrality and cost efficiency. To this end, energy modelling work has been carried out with the aim of minimising the costs of providing energy services, given the development of the different technologies and respecting the boundary conditions established in order to meet the objectives of the five dimensions of the Plan.  Given that three out of four tonnes of greenhouse gases originate in the energy system, its decarbonisation is the cornerstone on which the energy transition and decarbonisation of the economy are based. However, the INECP also devotes a great deal of attention to measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors.                                                             1 This is equivalent to a 38% reduction compared to total gross emissions in 2010 (357,677 MtCO-eq.), in line with the demands made by the IPCC to the international community in its 1.5 0C Special Report. This objective is fully consistent with a balanced path to climate neutrality in Spain in 2050. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 12 The measures for which the INECP 2021-2030 provides bring down total gross GHG emissions from the 319.3 MtCO2-eq predicted for the year 2020 to 221.8 MtCO2-eq in 2030. The sectors of the economy that, in absolute numbers, will reduce their emissions the most in this period are electricity generation (36 MtCO2-eq) and mobility and transport (27 MtCO2-eq), in addition to the residential, commercial and institutional sector and industry (combustion)2 with further decreases of 10 and 7 MtCO2-eq, respectively. These sectors considered together represent 83% of the emission reductions in the 2021-2030 period.  For the year 2030, the Plan foresees a total installed capacity in the electricity sector of 161 GW, 50 GW of which will be wind energy; 39 GW solar photovoltaic; 27 GW combined gas cycles3; 16 GW hydroelectric energy; 9.5 GW pumping; 7 GW solar thermal electric; and 3 GW nuclear, together with smaller amounts of other technologies. The total installed capacity of renewables for the different years is set out in the INECP. However, the precise breakdown between the technologies presented in this document corresponds to the current projection based on the costs and assumptions considered in the modelling exercise (see Annexes A and B). The actual distribution amongst renewable technologies each year between 2021 and 2030 will depend, in any case, on changes in their relative costs, as well as on the viability and flexibility of their implementation. Consequently, their relative weight may vary, within certain margins, with respect to the figures presented in this Plan.  Therefore, consequence of the application of European Union market instruments (tCO2-eq price of EUR 35 in 2030 at constant 2016 prices), coal plants will cease to provide energy to the system by 2030 at the latest, since they will find it difficult to remain competitive.  Renewable electricity generation in 2030 will represent 74% of the total, consistent with a path towards a 100% renewable electricity sector in 2050. It should be noted that there will be an additional 6 GW of storage, providing greater capacity for managing generation. Together with the drive for flexibility and demand management, this allows for greater integration of renewable generation into the system, which will contribute to security of supply.  Annex D of the Plan presents reports containing generation dispatch simulations carried out by Red Eléctrica de España (REE), both for the Baseline Scenario and for the Target Scenario. Although the marginal average cost4 should not be interpreted directly as the electricity price to the consumer, the change in the electricity mix provided for in the INECP 2021-2030 simulations, reduce the marginal average cost of generation by 31 % by 2030, compared to the cost envisaged in the Baseline Scenario. This will generate savings in the electricity system of EUR 6.109 billion in 2030 compared to the Baseline Scenario.  It is important to highlight that the increase of the renewable generation capacity envisaged in this Plan will require the involvement of the autonomous communities, which are responsible for spatial planning, as well as the drafting of additional management rules regarding the protection of the environment, so that the development of the generation facilities is effective and compatible with the environment and the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services.  The mobility and transport sector accounted for 26% of emissions in 2017. The reduction of                                                            2 Industry-Processes is the only sector of the economy that will increase its emissions (4%) in the period covered by the Plan. 3 Which correspond to the already existing combined cycles. 4 Does not include extra-peninsular systems. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 13 27 Mt CO2 equivalent between 2020 and 2030 equates to a 33% decrease. The main driving force for decarbonising the mobility and transport sector is a modal shift that will, according to the Plan, affect 35% of the passenger kilometres that are currently travelled in conventional combustion vehicles. To this end, it is expected that from 2023 onwards the creation of low-emission zones with limited access for the highest-emitting and most polluting vehicles will become widespread across all cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants; the regional administrations and local authorities will have key roles in introducing these measures. Another driver of the decarbonisation of the sector will be the presence of renewable energy in mobility and transport, which will reach 28% in 2030 through electrification (there will be 5 million electric vehicles in that year) and the use of advanced biofuels.  In the longer term, the necessary measures will be adopted in accordance with European regulations so that new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, excluding those registered as historic vehicles not intended for non-commercial [sic] uses, will gradually see their emissions reduced to 0 g CO2/km by 2040 at the latest. To this end, work will be carried out with the automotive sector and measures will be put in place to facilitate the development and penetration of these vehicles. This will include measures to support RDI. It is hoped that in the two decades between 2021 and 2040 the national automotive sector will be able to properly adapt to  and keep pace with  the changes that are envisaged in this sector.  Likewise, the Plan foresees that in the year 2030 the share of renewables in final energy use will be 42%. As regards the numerator, this will come about owing to the high penetration of electric and thermal renewable energy in all sectors of the economy as a result of measures that ensure visibility and stability in the medium term, greater flexibility and greater participation of citizens in the energy system, as well as specific support measures in those areas where they are needed. As regards the denominator, it will be brought about by the significant decrease in the amount of final energy required by the economy as a result of the progress made in savings and efficiency in all sectors.  The increase in renewable energy use between 2021 and 2030 is substantial in almost all economic sectors, as can be seen from the following data:   electricity generation: increases from 10,208 to 21,792 ktoe;  heat pumps: increases from 629 to 3,523 ktoe;  residential: increases from 2,640 to 2,876 ktoe;  industry: increases from 1,596 to 1,779 ktoe;  transport (biofuels): decreases from 2,348 to 2,111 ktoe;  services and other: increases from 241 to 435 ktoe;  agriculture: increases from 119 to 220 ktoe. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 14 Ultimately, the share of renewables in energy end-use will increase from an expected 20% for the year 2020 to 42% in 2030.  In addition, it is expected that the diversity of stakeholders and the existence of participatory projects both in renewable energy generation and in the energy system as a whole will increase, as a result of own consumption, distributed generation, demand management and the promotion of local energy communities, as well as specific measures aimed at promoting the proactive role of citizens in decarbonisation.  Apart from actions in the energy field, the Plan addresses the need to tackle emissions in non-ETS non-energy sectors, as well as to take advantage of the GHG absorption potential of natural sinks. The Plan proposes measures for non-energy sectors that can bridge the existing gap between the projected emissions and the commitments that Spain has made for non-ETS sectors in the 2021-2030 period.  Finally, the Plan recognises the long-term climate benefits of the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, and its potential to contribute to the goal of emission mitigation by 2030.  Energy efficiency  The INECP adopts the energy efficiency target of 32.5% as established in the Energy Efficiency  Scenario the reduction in primary energy consumption  compared to the European baseline scenario established by the PRIMES model in 2007 is 39.5% by 2030, so that primary energy consumption will be 98.5 Mtoe in that year5. The reduction in primary energy consumption proposed in this Plan is equivalent to 1.9% every year since 2017, which when linked to an expected annual increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the same period of 1.7%, results in an improvement in primary energy intensity of 3.5% per year until 2030.  In addition to this objective, the Energy Efficiency Directive requires Member States to demonstrate the achievement of a cumulative end-use energy savings target in the period: firstly, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020, and secondly, between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2030. This cumulative end-use energy savings target has been calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Directive. For the first period, it amounts to 15,979 ktoe and for the second period, it is equivalent to 36,809 ktoe, which means that new and additional savings equivalent to 669 ktoe/year are achieved every year, from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030.  The Plan also proposes that public administrations should set an example in energy saving and efficiency. Thus, it proposes initiatives for achieving the target for renovating public building stock established in the Energy Efficiency Directive (3%) and evaluates and promotes savings that can be obtained by renovating an additional 300,000 m2/year in the General State Administration. In accordance with the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Plan encourages autonomous communities and local authorities, at least, to adopt the mandatory target for the General State Administration of renovating 3% of the built and heated area of the public building stock, as this will achieve a much more ambitious energy-saving target.                                                             5 Not including non-energy uses. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 15 This responsible approach by the public sector is completed with the Ecological Public Procurement Plan of the General State Administration, its autonomous agencies and the Social Security management entities (2018-2025).  Energy security  Given the changes in the energy mix that are proposed in this Plan, supplying safe, clean and efficient energy to the different consumer sectors will involve significant technological challenges, which must be addressed from the different dimensions of energy security:   reduction of dependency, especially on fossil fuel imports;  diversification of energy and supply sources;  preparation for possible supply limitations or interruptions;  increase in the flexibility of the national energy system. Specifically, and as regards reducing energy dependency, the starting point is energy consumption in 2017 of 132 Mtoe in terms of primary energy, 99 Mtoe of which were, almost entirely, imported fossil fuels.  After application of the measures included in this National Plan, it is foreseen that energy consumption of 104 Mtoe6 will be achieved in 2030, 67 Mtoe of which will be fossil fuels. Accordingly, renewable energy and energy efficiency action will lower the degree of dependency on imported energy from 74% in 2017 to 61% in 2030. In addition to improving national energy security, this will have a very positive impact on the trade balance.  Within the field of energy security, the security of electricity supply is of central importance. The analyses performed by various models indicate that security of electricity supply would be guaranteed with the power generation mix presented in the Target Scenario. This technical analysis is provided in Annex D 2 (Guarantee of Supply: Probabilistic analysis of coverage under the 2030 Target Scenario). In addition, the models used in the INECP, which are specific to the electricity sector, are presented in Annex B (Models).  As regards the security of electricity supply, the following should be noted in relation to the phasing-out of coal and nuclear power in electricity generation by 2030 (four of the seven reactors will be closed), both of which are envisaged in the Target Scenario of this Plan:  Firstly, this reduction in capacity is offset by the significant penetration of renewable electricity generation technologies, in particular solar and wind technologies (see Chapter 2, Table 2.3. Evolution of the installed capacity of electricity).  Secondly, Spain has combined-cycle gas plants with a capacity totalling 26,612 MW, which, together with storage and demand management, provide back-up capacity when it comes to evolving towards this transition in the electricity mix during the decade 2021-2030.                                                               6 Including non-energy uses. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 16 Finally, the aforementioned REE reports conclude that the supply under the Target Scenario envisaged in this Plan is fully guaranteed under the most demanding circumstances in terms of weather conditions.  At the same time, and in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050, the Plan addresses the need to anticipate and plan, together with the System Operator, the technologies, procedures and mechanisms that will make it possible to guarantee security of supply without greenhouse gas emissions.  The lines of work included in this dimension of the Plan are as follows:   increasing the electricity interconnection of the systems, which will help to reduce possible negative impacts due to supply constraints or interruptions;  optimising the use of existing capacity by reducing barriers to the exchange of electricity (see the section on the internal market);  intensifying contingency planning, which is currently very advanced, in the framework of the different international contexts in which Spain is involved: the International Energy Agency (IEA) and various EU directives and regulations for the electricity and gas sector;  developing the National Security Strategy and the Energy Security Strategy through the Special Committee on Energy Security;  adapting to the new European regulation on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector;  improving the different preventive and emergency plans with regard to the supply of electricity, gas and petroleum derivatives. Finally, attention has been paid to cybersecurity. In April 2019, Spain adopted its National Cybersecurity Strategy, the purpose of which is to implement the provisions of the 2017 National Security Strategy. Moreover, Spain has had a National Energy Security Strategy since 2015.  This strategy has promoted and strengthened public-private collaboration with the various energy operators, a task that has been coordinated by the Cybersecurity Coordination Office (OCC) of the National Centre for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Cybersecurity (CNPIC). The designated critical operators in the field of energy and nuclear industry have also presented their respective Operator Security Plans (OSPs), checking that they are adapted to the current situation of threats and challenges to which critical infrastructure in the energy sector and nuclear industry are subject, and updating the information contained in these plans.  Internal energy market  in relation to the Internal Energy Market dimension respond to the need for a more competitive, transparent, flexible and non-discriminatory energy market with a high degree of interconnection that promotes cross-border trade and contributes to energy security. This requires adequate consumer protection, especially for vulnerable consumers, as well as enhanced competition and effective integration in the European market, with the relevant infrastructure.    1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 17 With regard to electricity infrastructure, the integration of renewable energy generation necessitates the strengthening and expansion of transport and distribution lines in Spanish territory, including mainland connections, non-mainland systems and interconnections between island systems. The Plan addresses all of these aspects, as well as the development of mechanisms for the management and storage of non-dispatchable electric renewables that will prevent discharges.  The increase in interconnections within the non-mainland electricity systems will have a direct impact on energy and climate, since coal, fuel or diesel power plants play a greater role in the power generation mix of these systems than on the mainland. In this regard, the Plan envisages that the contribution of fossil fuel plants located in isolated electrical systems will be reduced by at least 50% by 2030.  At EU level, the degree of interconnection between the Iberian electricity system and the rest of the European continent is below the established targets. than 5% of the generation capacity installed in the system. In 2020, despite the planned interconnections, Spain will be the only country in the European Union that falls below the 10% target, so it will be necessary to continue developing new interconnections:   A new interconnection with Portugal, which will increase the exchange capacity to 3,000 MW.  New interconnections with France, which will increase interconnection capacity to 8,000 MW: o the Bay of Biscay project: between Aquitaine (FR) and the Basque Country (ES); o an interconnection between Aragon (ES) and Pyrénées-Atlantiques (FR); o an interconnection between Navarre (ES) and Landes (FR).  The Plan foresees continuous regional cooperation with neighbouring countries in, at least, the areas of energy security and the internal market. In this connection, on 9 July 2019, the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge (MITECO) held a working session in Madrid attended by representatives of the European Commission, Portugal, France and Spain. In addition to energy market and potential future avenues for cooperation were discussed. Finally, the Plan promotes various measures to protect and strengthen the role of consumers. With regard to energy poverty, the Plan takes into account the National Strategy against Energy Poverty7 approved on 5 April 2019 by the Council of Ministers. The Strategy, in line with the approach and methodology of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory, is an instrument that will enable the phenomenon of energy poverty to be addressed with an integrated approach and a medium and long-term vision.  Research, innovation and competitiveness  The Energy Union includes a dimension on research, innovation and competitiveness in which the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) plays a leading role. This has been the RDI pillar of European energy and climate policy since 2007.  Through the SET Plan, actions for innovation and research in low-carbon technologies are                                                            7 https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/prensa/estrategianacionalcontralapobrezaenergetica2019-2024_tcm30- 496282.pdf 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 18 coordinated among the participating countries, namely the EU Member States as well as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Turkey. Financial support for projects arising from the SET Plan is provided by the Horizon 2020 programme. Within the SET Plan framework, the Spanish authorities work in different groups that address the needs for research, innovation and competitiveness (RIC) in sectors such as photovoltaic energy, concentrated solar power, wind power and energy efficiency.  policy on scientific research, technological development and innovation; for this reason, it is responsible for implementing this dimension in the energy sector in coordination with MITECO and the other agents involved. Together with the Ministry, the following participate in this task:   The State Research Agency (AEI), which is responsible for the financing, evaluation, award and monitoring of scientific and technical research activities. The Technological Platforms are a particularly important part of its work.  The Industrial and Technological Development Centre (CDTI), which aims to increase the competitiveness of Spanish companies by raising their technological level, for which it funds business RIC projects.  Public Research Organisations, such as the Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology (Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas y Tecnológicas, CIEMAT), which focus on programme implementation.  The RIC activities aimed at combating climate change and promoting the energy transition are organised in the following lines of work:   Energy Efficiency, characterised by its cross-cutting nature in terms of the technologies and sectors involved.  Renewable energy technologies:  o those in which Spain already has a competitive position, with a high level of participation of its companies, such as wind, solar photovoltaic and solar thermoelectric; o renewable fuels for the transport sector, particularly the development of advanced biofuels; o others in which Spain has significant natural resources and sufficient local implementation potential to develop technological learning curves: offshore wind energy, biomass, marine energy, waste, as well as low-enthalpy geothermal energy.  Flexibility and optimisation of the energy system by implementing technologies that provide flexibility to the electricity system, which is essential in order to achieve a high degree of penetration in the non-dispatchable renewable generation system: o electricity storage, with and without electric vehicles, and demand-side participation in system operation; o thermal storage, particularly linked to solar thermal technologies; o hydroelectric storage; o chemical storage in the form of hydrogen, either by using electrolysis and consumption in fuel cells, or by injecting it into the network. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 19  Electric vehicles: batteries and the installation and optimisation of charging points. As far as competitiveness is concerned, Spain is one of the European countries with the highest potential for exploiting renewable energy. It extends over 50 million hectares, including large areas of low population density, and benefits from Mediterranean and Atlantic winds, high levels of sunshine, extensive forests and substantial water resources, and these are complemented by a business, technological, innovation and knowledge network in this area.  Our country has leading international companies in sectors that will be important for the energy transition; it has significant knowledge capital with pioneering institutions such as CIEMAT, the National Centre for Renewable Energy (CENER), the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving research centres, universities, technological networks and a strong industrial network in the field of renewable energies.  The INECP allows Spain to aspire to be one of the leading European Union countries in the energy transition. The Spanish economy can benefit greatly from this transformation in terms of competitiveness, in the form of prosperity, energy security, job creation in industry, innovation, technological development and the elimination of energy poverty.  The reduction in electricity costs through the use of renewable technologies will clearly improve the competitiveness of electricity-intensive companies. In addition, this Plan includes the implementation of measures in industry that will initiate changes in production processes and a move towards those that have the best technical improvements available. The planned improvements in energy efficiency also have a positive effect on the industrial and production fabric, on large, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as on households and individuals.  renewable technology value chains, as well as to map existing technological, industrial and knowledge capacities, an Industrial Development Plan will be drawn up, in which the energy transition will be a central element. In this sense, the objective of the Plan will be to lay the foundations so that Spain can fully exploit the potential in terms of bringing about economic development and creating industrial jobs as a result of the energy transition.  The economic, employment, distributive and health impacts of the INECP, 2021-2030  The energy transition set out in this Plan represents an important economic and employment opportunity for our country, as shown by the technical impact analysis (see Chapter 4), the most important conclusions of which are set out below.  The total investments to achieve the objectives of the Plan will amount to EUR 241.412 billion between 2021 and 2030. Of this amount, EUR 196 billion are additional investments compared to the Baseline Scenario (without additional policies). The total investments are distributed between:    bn)   bn)   bn)   bn) 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 20 With regard to the source of the investments, a substantial proportion of the total investment will be made by the private sector (80% of the total), mainly linked to the deployment of renewable energy, distribution and transmission networks, and a large part of the saving and efficiency measures. The public sector will make the rest of the investment (20% of the total), in actions related to promoting energy saving and energy efficiency, sustainable mobility and the modal shift. In the case of public sector investments, a portion is expected to come from European funds.  The INECP will generate an increase in GDP between EUR 16.5 billion and EUR 25.7 billion per year (1.8% of GDP in 2030). This positive impact comes from the economic boost generated by investments in renewable energy, savings and efficiency and networks, on the one hand, and the t increase in employment of 253,000 and 348,000 people (a 1.7% increase in employment in 2030). Regarding the trade balance, the Plan will result in cumulative savings in fossil fuel imports of EUR 67.381 billion between 2021 and 2030, compared to the Baseline Scenario.  In the case of distributive impacts, the measures will benefit low-income households, particularly vulnerable groups. The evaluation confirms how the effect on final consumption increases to a greater extent in the lowest income quintiles, that is, the INECP measures have a gradual effect. The evaluation also shows a positive effect on the most vulnerable consumers, since energy expenditure represents a higher percentage of their disposable income.  Finally, the health benefits to individuals of the measures identified to achieve climate and energy goals have been analysed: in particular, the improvements that result from the reduction of atmospheric pollutants emitted as a result of burning fossil fuels. According to the analysis carried out, a decrease of around 2,400 premature deaths is expected in 2030 compared to the Baseline Scenario, with the corresponding economic co-benefits in terms of public health.  Establishing the Plan  The process for establishing the INECP was facilitated by including the energy, climate change and environment areas of competence in a Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge; this has made it possible to align energy and climate change policies and strengthened the governance of the transition. With this starting point and in order to make progress in the five dimensions considered in the Plan, the following steps have been performed:  First, this Plan was considered to be a key element for Spain to adequately and responsibly fulfil the requirements arising from the Paris Agreement.  Second, the complete interrelationship and consistency between this Plan and the 2050 Low Emission Strategy for the Spanish economy, a long-term decarbonisation roadmap that Spain will present this year, 2019, as a result of the obligations assumed by the European Union under the Paris Agreement. In this way, the medium (2030) and long-term (2050) approaches are aligned.  Third, the Plan is presented as part of the Energy and Climate Strategic Framework, accompanied by the Climate Change and Energy Transition Bill, which sets minimum targets for emissions reductions for 2030 and 2050, providing predictability and a sense of direction. It is also accompanied by the Just Transition Strategy, which, based on solidarity, is designed to anticipate and manage the consequences on those regions and people directly linked to technologies that will be progressively 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 21 displaced as a result of the energy transition promoted by this Plan.  In addition, the aforementioned National Strategy against Energy Poverty has been designed. In this way, and through these five regulatory and policy documents, Spain has provided itself with a complete Strategic Framework, laying the foundations for an orderly transformation of the economy and society towards an economically more efficient, and more socially just system, with lower polluting and GHG emissions.  Fourth, the involvement of the different ministries has been sought and achieved through the establishment and regular meetings of the Interministerial Commission on Climate Change and Energy Transition, as well as through numerous specific bilateral meetings to discuss and assess the measures and instruments necessary to achieve the objectives of the Plan.  Fifth, coordination with the autonomous communities has been  and will continue to be  encouraged through the Climate Change Policy Coordination Commission, in order to identify the interlinkages of this Plan with regional policies, seeking the full involvement of each area of the administration in order to meet its objectives.  Sixth, an extensive participatory process aimed at presenting and communicating the Plan has been carried out, which has revolved around the following elements. Firstly, the Public Consultation on the INECP in March and April 2019, which resulted in almost 1,200 comments. Secondly, numerous meetings were held during the second half of 2018 and throughout 2019 with business entities and social and environmental organisations on different aspects related to the Plan. Thirdly, during the first half of 2019, the INECP was presented at a number of public events in which business organisations, trade unions, environmental NGOs and other civil society organisations participated; the needs and opportunities linked to the development of the plan were discussed and explored at these events.  Seventh, the National Plan is also linked to the other major aspect of climate change, namely adaptation to the pressures and impacts arising from it (see Annex C for a detailed list of current climate policies in Spain). At the same time, when deploying the significant developments in renewable technologies set out in the Plan, Spain will ensure that it will responsibly protect its natural heritage, particularly by protecting its biodiversity, which is one of the richest and most valuable in the European Union.  In particular, the implementation of the Plan will take into account the specific measures for the conservation of habitats and species of Community interest that are listed in the management plans for Natura 2000 sites in the autonomous communities. In addition, plans for the reintroduction, conservation and recovery of threatened species at national and autonomous community level will be taken into account, so that the necessary development of renewable technologies foreseen in this INECP is complemented by and in balance with the necessary protection of biological diversity and ecosystem services. In this respect, the Plan is intended to achieve a harmonious interaction with the Strategic Plan for Natural Heritage and Biodiversity, as well as with the Strategic Plan for the Conservation and Wise Use of Wetlands.  The measures in the Plan related to the development of water resources will take into consideration the protection of public water resources, as well as the status of water bodies. In particular, measures that may affect river systems will have to reconcile planning for the sustainable development of water resources with the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 22  Eighth, this National Plan is also complemented by the Circular Economy Strategy, which was approved in 2019. The relationships between decarbonisation and the circular economy will, however, be addressed in detail as part of the 2050 Long-Term Strategy.  Ninth, one of the risks of greatest concern to industry in the European Union in relation to climate action is that regulation and the current and future price signals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will damage its competitiveness if its relative production costs are increased and equivalent measures are not introduced in third countries. This risk is higher for those sectors that are energy-intensive and more open to global competition. Aware of this risk, the European Union has established that the sectors considered to be exposed can receive special treatment so as not to affect their competitiveness. To this end, it drew up a list of sectors included in the CO2 market (EU ETS). Installations active in these sectors received a higher share of free allowances than other industrial installations in the period 2013-2020, significantly reducing their costs of participating in the EU ETS.  Recently, with a view to the implementation of the EU ETS in the period 2021-2030, the European Commission has prepared an updated list and has decided to maintain the free allocation of emission allowances until 2030. Likewise, Member States have the possibility of compensating the electricity-intensive sectors through state aid programmes to reimburse them for the indirect costs associated with the impact of the price of the emission allowance on electricity. In this regard, it continues to be acknowledged that there is a risk that emissions will be transferred to other regions (carbon leakage), and measures are taken to prevent this risk from materialising.  Tenth, the Plan has a strong commitment to a gender perspective. According to recent studies by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), it is estimated that the percentage of women in all renewable energy jobs internationally is 32%, while the percentage in Spain is 26%. This is a lower percentage than for the economy as a whole and is similar to the percentage in industry as a whole. Given the competition between sectors of the economy to attract talent, the fact that the number of graduates or postgraduates in technical subjects remains constant in Europe, and the need for a skilled workforce in order to implement the Plan, it is clear that the participation of women on equal conditions will increase in the renewable energy sector.  Eleventh, the INECP 2021-2030 is fully connected to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. Although the Plan has a particularly direct impact on SDGs 7 and 13 (affordable and clean energy for all and climate action, respectively), interactions with the other SDGs are important, as explained in Annex E, in which the actions envisaged in this Plan are linked to the different Sustainable Development Goals.  Finally, regarding the analytical basis of the Plan, a large team of experts was set up with people from different departments of MITECO, which in turn received technical assistance from academic and advanced research centres with extensive experience and knowledge in the fields of economics, energy and climate change, as well as the important collaboration of REE. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 23 1.2 OVERVIEW OF CURRENT POLICY SITUATION The framework for climate and energy policy in Spain is determined by the international context and European Union policy. In this framework, the Paris Agreement, reached in 2015, is particularly important; it is aimed at maintaining the global average temperature increase below 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels, and to make efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C8. The EU ratified the Agreement in October 2016 (which allowed its entry into force in November 2016) and Spain followed in 2017. The entry into force of this Agreement gave new impetus to energy and climate change policies.  1.2.1 Energy and Climate in the European Union  With a view to the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the European Council agreed on the 2030 EU climate and energy policy framework in October 2014. Taking into account this time frame, it set a target of reducing GHG emissions by at least 40% compared to 1990 levels. In addition, amendments were proposed to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and measures for sectors not subject to this scheme were proposed, as well as targets for the share of renewables in final energy consumption, improved energy efficiency and interconnections.  In order to achieve these objectives, to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, to comply with the Paris Agreement and to move towards the achievement of the Energy Union in its five dimensions (decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal market and RIC), the European Commission prepared a series of legislative proposals presented in 2015 and 2016:   review of the emissions trading legislative framework for its next trading period (phase 4);  effort-sharing between the Member States in order to meet the common objective of reducing emissions in sectors not covered by the Emissions Trading Directive (proposal for an EU Regulation);  inclusion of GHGs and sinks from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), in the Climate and Energy 2030 framework (proposal for an EU Regulation);  9 that included reviews and legislative proposals on energy efficiency, buildings, renewable energies, electricity market design, security of supply and governance rules for the Energy Union.  The European institutions have already approved most of the aforementioned proposals; these include reviews of and legislative proposals on energy efficiency10, renewable energy11, electricity market design12, security of supply and governance rules for the Energy Union13.                                                            8 The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that the observed increase in the average temperature of the planet exceeds 1 °C compared to the average temperature of the pre-industrial era. 9 Clean Energy for All Europeans; COM(2016) 860 final. 10 Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. 11 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 12 Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (Text with EEA relevance). 13 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 24 This new regulatory framework provides regulatory certainty and favourable conditions for investment to take place, empowers European consumers to become players in the energy transition and sets binding targets for the EU by 203014:  40% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 1990;  32% share of renewable energy in total gross final energy consumption;  32.5% improvement in energy efficiency;  15% electricity interconnection between the Member States. As regards the other dimensions of the Energy Union, it should be noted that the form of action in the event of supply limitations is defined under energy security, and objectives are set in order to increase the diversification of energy and supply sources, as well as to reduce energy imports. In the case of Spain, given the prevalence of fossil fuels in the national energy system, it is characterised by high energy dependency, which reaches 73%, well above the EU average (54%). On the positive side, Spain has one of the highest levels of diversification of gas and oil suppliers in Europe. With regard to the internal market, the electricity interconnection target for Member States is set at 15% by 2030.  In research, innovation and competitiveness, national and financing objectives are set for both public and private research and innovation. Finally, with a view to 2050, on 28 November 2018 the European Commission updated its roadmap towards decarbonisation of the economy with the intention of making the European Union carbon neutral by 205015 (zero net GHG emissions).  1.2.2 Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union  Decarbonisation of the economy  The decarbonisation policies and measures developed to date are part of the Spanish Strategy on Climate Change and Clean Energy, which was approved by the Council of Ministers on 2 November 2007 and designed for the period to 2020. Subsequently, the entry into force of the new European framework with the definition of objectives for 2020 resulted in an expansion of the aforementioned strategy with new planning instruments, which are listed below (see links to the documents):   Road map to 2020 for the non-ETS sectors.16, 17  Information on actions in the land use, land use change and forestry sector in Spain18.

OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 25  National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change.20  Third work programme of the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change.21 In the case of GHGs in non-ETS sectors (residential, transport, agriculture, waste, fluorinated gases and industry not subject to emissions trading), this capacity was reflected in the Roadmap to 2020 for non-ETS sectors, which was published in September 2014. It consists of an analysis of future emission scenarios and their comparison with the objectives arising from the EU Effort Sharing Decision (Decision No 406/2009/EC), specifically with the objective of reducing non-ETS emissions by 10% in 2020 compared to 2005 levels. The analyses carried out have made it possible to identify the existing gap to achieving this reduction commitment. Accordingly, options and additional action measures are being considered. If they are implemented with the appropriate degree of intensity, they will allow Spain to meet the 2020 objectives in a cost-efficient manner.  The existing policies and measures at national level which have been adopted and/or implemented to date aimed at decarbonisation or which have an impact on GHG reduction, are spread among different sectors and departments. The detailed list of these can be found in Annex C. In addition, there are autonomous communities and local authorities that have put in place ambitious energy and climate plans and measures within their areas of competence.  It is important to note the implementation in non-ETS sectors of the Climate Projects promoted through the Carbon Fund for a Sustainable Economy (FES-CO2) and designed to forge a path of transformation for the Spanish productive system towards a low-carbon model, as well as the Environmental Promotion Plans (PIMA), which are measures to combat climate change at a national level. The creation of a tax on fluorinated gases that has allowed a rapid transformation in this sector by drastically reducing its emissions is equally noteworthy.  As regards the sectors subject to emission rights trading, the European scheme is regulated by Law 1/2005 of 9 March 2005 as well as by various Royal Decrees that implement it. This scheme affects around 900 industrial and electricity-generation facilities in Spain. Spain has also been assigned the management of more than 30 active air operators, approximately half of which are foreign.  In the field of renewables, the Renewable Energy Plan (Plan de Energías Renovables, PER) 2011-2020 in force sets targets in accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The PER sets the target of achieving at least 20.8% of gross final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 (39% of total electricity consumption) and a contribution from these sources to the energy consumption of transport of 11.3% in the same year, thus exceeding the mandatory minimum targets established for Spain in the Renewable Energy Directive. In our country, the regulation of the electricity system has undergone continuous regulatory changes, which led to reforms aimed at guaranteeing the economic and financial sustainability of the system in the long term, with the aim of containing the growing tariff deficit.

OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 26 players in the electricity system, adjusted the remuneration for electricity generation technologies using renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste and initially discouraged new developments.  However, the need to meet the aforementioned renewable energy objective in 2020 gave a new impetus to their deployment. To this end, a specific remuneration scheme was established in order to encourage production from renewable energy sources, high efficiency cogeneration and waste on the basis of competitive tendering procedures (auctions). Therefore, in 2016 notice was given of the first auction for the specific remuneration scheme for new installations producing electricity have been carried out and 9,292.4 MW of new renewable capacity have been assigned as a result.  Likewise, with the approval of Royal Decree-Law 15/2018, an exceptional extension was granted to the access permits and electrical connection of renewable energies previously granted that would otherwise have expired on 31 December 2018. By means of this extension, it will be possible to begin operating the renewable installed capacity awarded in the latest auctions in 2020 and contribute to achieving the 20% target by that year.  Additionally, the policy of promoting renewable energies develops and strengthens existing synergies with other measures recently approved in the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law 15/2018 aimed at improving the protection of energy consumers, promoting sustainable mobility through electric vehicles, liberalising recharge activity and boosting renewable electricity own consumption.  With regard to the last point, it should be noted that in Spain own consumption has barely taken off yet, owing to the existence of a series of regulatory barriers that have hindered its economic viability. However, Royal Decree 244/2019, regulating the administrative, technical and economic conditions for own consumption of electricity, aims to make it easier for consumers to obtain cleaner energy at a lower cost.  For its part, support for renewable energy sources for heating, cooling and off-grid electricity generation is mainly put into practice through subsidies for installed capacity from the autonomous communities. In addition, with respect to financial aid for renewable energy, existing programmes for financing projects have continued; these are mostly managed by the IDAE of MITECO. These are integrated actions aimed at promoting the use of renewable energies (solar, biomass and geothermal energy) in the residential and tertiary sectors and encouraging energy savings and the improvement of energy efficiency in existing buildings.  The promotion of the use of biofuels was given fresh momentum most recently in late 2015 (Royal Decree 1085/2015 of 4 December 2015 on the promotion of biofuels) through new minimum and mandatory annual sales or consumption targets (4.3%, 5%, 6%, 7% and 8.5%, for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively). Obligated undertakings can achieve them in a flexible manner through biofuel certificates for either diesel or gasoline.  Finally, it should be noted that among recent initiatives to reduce emissions, a framework agreement for the coal sector was reached and signed on 24 October 2018 between the Government, trade unions and representatives of the sector. The main objective of this agreement was to promote a just transition from coal mining and to promote the sustainable development of mining regions during the 2019-2027 period. The agreement responds to social repercussions 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 27 arising from compliance with Decision 2010/787/EU of the European Council, which requires the closure of coal mines in European Union territory or, otherwise, the return of State aid received in the 2011-2018 period.  Energy efficiency  The energy efficiency policy is implemented through the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2017-2020 (which follows on from the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2014-2020), which was sent to Brussels in April 2017. This meets the requirement of Article 24(2) of the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 25 October 2012, which requires all Member States of the European Union to submit the first plan by 30 April 2014, and every three years thereafter.  Current measures to promote energy efficiency include a range of legislative and/or economic support actions, aimed at producing a general or specific impact on each consumption sector. The most important structural decision was the establishment of the system of energy efficiency obligations, together with the creation of the National Energy Efficiency Fund (FNEE), in order to finance national energy efficiency initiatives (as provided in Royal Decree-Law 8/2014 of 4 July 2014 approving urgent measures for growth, competitiveness and efficiency ratified by Law 18/2014 of 15 October 2014).  The FNEE, which is led by its Monitoring and Control Committee, an interdepartmental body in which the main ministries with competences in this area are represented, is managed by the IDAE. Its purpose is to finance support mechanisms for economic and financial aid, technical assistance, training, information or other measures to increase energy efficiency in the different energy-consuming sectors, in a way that contributes to achieving the national energy-saving target established by the national system of obligations provided for in Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. This Fund coordinates efficiency measures through calls for proposals co-financed with Structural Funds.  The promotion of energy efficiency in cities has had two main components or lines of action: buildings, on the one hand, and mobility of passengers and goods on the other. The actions to improve energy efficiency of buildings form part of the long-term strategy for energy upgrading in the building sector in Spain (ERESEE), which includes different pieces of legislation. For example, the Technical Building Code22 (CTE), the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings23 (RITE) or the Energy Certification System for Buildings,24 among others. At present, both the CTE and the RITE are being updated as they are scheduled to be updated every five years, and, also to include the new requirements arising from the amendments to the Energy Efficiency Directive (2018/2002/EU) and the Energy Efficiency in Buildings Directive (2018/844/EU).  Within the building sector, the Aid Programme for the energy upgrading of existing buildings (PAREER-CRECE Programme) and the JESSICA-FIDAE Fund, which are both managed by the IDAE, are significant. The latter has funded urban projects for energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies.                                                            22 Royal Decree 314/2006 of 17 March 2006 approving the Technical Building Code. 23 Royal Decree 1027/2007 of 20 July 2007 updated by Royal Decree 238/2013 of 5 April 2013 amending certain articles and technical instructions of the RITE. 24 Royal Decree 235/2013 of 5 April 2013 approving the basic procedure for the certification of the energy efficiency of buildings. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 28  Energy efficiency in cities is coordinated by the public administration through integrated sustainable urban development strategies (SUDS) aimed at urban functional areas.  Actions to improve energy efficiency in transport and sustainable mobility in cities have been aimed at encouraging the modal shift in the mobility of people and goods towards modes that consume less energy per passenger-km or tonne-km; the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is one of the pillars for the promotion of new mobility services. These also included actions aimed at improving the efficiency of the fleet of vehicles through fleet renewal, especially of last-mile urban distribution vehicles, the gradual incorporation of electric vehicles and other technological advances, as well as actions aimed at the efficient use of the modes of transport.  Additionally, the promotion of high-efficiency cogeneration and urban heating and cooling networks, as well as energy-efficiency measures in transformation, transport, distribution and demand-side participation have been part of the comprehensive strategy for energy-efficiency in cities.  For its part, energy-efficiency in non-urban environments and, therefore, in sectors other than those of construction or transport has benefited from support measures tailored to the specificities of each sector. A policy of financial support for industrial investment has prevailed in industry within the framework of public policy to promote competitiveness. In addition, there have been and currently are aid programmes for SMEs and large companies that are funded by the FNEE. These programmes aim to encourage and promote the performance of actions in the industrial sector that reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency.  In short, the implementation of measures of the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency 2017-2020 and previous plans contributed to an improvement in energy efficiency, which was reflected during the period 2004 to 2016 and quantified as an annual decrease of 2% in final energy intensity.  Energy Security  As has already been indicated, Spain depends heavily on foreign sources for energy  73% in 2017  due to the prevalence in its energy mix of fossil fuels that have to be imported in their entirety, given that national production is almost nil. The imports of hydrocarbons are, therefore, very important in the field of energy security, which is understood as security of supply.  States, due to a milder climate, resulting in a lower penetration of natural gas among domestic consumers and central heating.  As for petroleum products, their presence in the national energy mix is much higher than the EU average, for the following reasons:   high development of freight transport by road to the detriment of rail transport (2% on average in Spain, compared to an average of 17% in the EU);  significant consumption of maritime transport compared to Member States that are almost landlocked; 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 29  significant consumption of air transport due to the highly important tourism sector.  With reference to the national production of hydrocarbons, it should be noted that this is practically non-existent. Data for 2017 are as follows:   Domestic production of natural gas (2017): 23 ktoe (0.09% of needs).  Domestic crude production (2017): 122,000 tonnes (0.21% of needs). The main countries of origin for the different sources of energy are the following:  Electricity: Spain has electricity interconnections with France, Portugal and Morocco.  Natural gas: in 2017, 53% of imports were made through gas pipelines, compared to 47% in methane tankers (in the form of Liquefied Natural Gas through regasification plants). Currently, the most important international pipelines are Maghreb (Maghreb-Europe), Medgaz (Algeria-Almeria) and the interconnections with France and Portugal. The breakdown of imports of natural gas in 2017 by country of origin was as follows: o Algeria (48%) o Nigeria (12%) o Peru (10%) o Qatar (10%) o Norway (10%) o Other (10%)  Petroleum products: the main countries of origin for crude oil in 2017 were the following: o Mexico (15%) o Nigeria (14%) o Saudi Arabia (10%)  In view of the foregoing, the relative dependence on the imports of natural gas from Algeria can be highlighted as a possible risk, which is offset by the high level of imports by methane tankers from a wide range of countries of origin.  It may be concluded that Spain has one of the highest levels of diversification of gas and petroleum suppliers in Europe.  Finally, it should be pointed out that regional cooperation for energy supply is an essential element in the stability and prosperity of the countries and regions surrounding Spain. They are the is a member. In this connection, at its Ministerial Conference in Italy (1 December 2017), three new energy platforms were approved: one for the gas market, another for the regional electricity market, and a third focused on renewable energy and energy efficiency. The objective was to organise and strengthen dialogue between the Member States of the Mediterranean region, their financial institutions, experts, regional organisations and industry.   Internal energy market: interconnectivity, infrastructure and market 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 30  Planning of the electricity transmission infrastructure is governed by the 2015-2020 Electricity transmission network development plan, which includes the necessary infrastructure to guarantee security of supply in the 2015-2020 planning horizon. It introduces environmental and economic efficiency criteria and establishes security and reliability requirements for the electricity grid, with the aim of increasing the international connection capacity and, as a result, the integration of Spain in the single energy market.  The current plan integrates renewable energies into the network, in order to facilitate the achievement of the targets in this area for 2020, and it is adapted to the demand needs arising from new industrial activity. Investments associated with electricity infrastructure planned for the 2020 horizon are estimated to total EUR 4.554 billion, with an average annual investment of EUR 759 million, of which EUR 143 million are expected to be recovered from ERDF Funds throughout the period.  With reference to cross-border electricity interconnections, work that has been carried out to extend the interconnections with France involved putting a new line into service in the east of the Pyrenees. This has doubled the electricity exchange capacity between Spain and France (from 1,400 MW to 2,800 MW). It has helped to strengthen the security of the two electricity systems and to facilitate the integration of a greater volume of renewable energy, especially wind power from the Iberian system.  However, despite this expansion, the level of electricity interconnection between Spain and France is less than 3% of installed electricity production capacity in Spain. This falls far short of the targets of the Energy Union: 10% of installed electricity production capacity for all Member States by 2020 and 15% by 2030. With the interconnections planned to date, in 2020 Spain will be one of few European countries with a level of interconnection below 10%. It will therefore be necessary to continue developing new interconnections.  To this end, and in the framework of collaboration initiated with the 2015 Madrid Summit, an increase in the interconnection capacity with France is planned with the following extensions:   an interconnection between Aquitaine (FR) and the Basque Country (ES), through a submarine cable through the Bay of Biscay, which will allow the interconnection capacity between Spain and France to reach 5,000 MW;  an interconnection between Aragon (ES) and Pyrénées-Atlantiques (FR) and an interconnection between Navarre (ES) and Landas (FR), which will increase the interconnection capacity between Spain and France to 8,000 MW.  The future planning of the natural gas transmission infrastructure will be carried out once the new regulatory development of the hydrocarbon sector is approved. This will include the procedure for it. So far, the basic regulation is contained in Law 34/1998 of 7 October 1998 on the Hydrocarbons Sector, as well as in the provisions of Articles 79 and 80 of Law 2/2011 of 4 March 2011 on sustainable economy. The reference document is the Plan for the electricity and gas sectors 2008-2016, approved on 30 May 2008 by an Agreement of the Council of Ministers. This document, based on an analysis of the sector and demand forecasts, establishes criteria for developing the basic natural gas network, points of entry, and technical criteria for the design of gas pipelines and storage capacity. In this current plan, the need for new transmission capacity, storage and regasification infrastructure is analysed and identified, designing the main aspects in such a way 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 31 that a safe and flexible system is established whereby all the gas zones are connected.  With regard to the organisation of the market, Directive 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and Directive 2009/73/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas provide that if the internal markets in electricity and natural gas are to function properly, energy regulators need to be able to take decisions in relation to all relevant regulatory issues and to be independent from any other public or private interests. The European regulatory framework establishes that the regulatory authority shall, inter alia, promote a competitive, flexible, secure and environmentally sustainable internal market; support the development of consumer-oriented systems; encourage energy efficiency and the integration of large and small-scale renewable energy; and ensure that operators and users are granted tasks include monitoring the market opening and competition in wholesale and retail markets, as well as removing barriers to the development of own consumption own data.  Therefore, Royal Decree-Law 1/2019 of 11 January 2019 on urgent measures to adapt the powers of the National Commission on Markets and Competition to the requirements of EU law, in relation to Directives 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas, distributed competences in accordance with the EU framework and provided the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) with the independence and powers necessary for the exercise of its functions. Royal Decree-Law 1/2019 establishes that, among other things, the CNMC is responsible for setting the remuneration of the electricity system operator and the technical manager of the gas system, adopting the methodology, remuneration criteria, the regulatory asset base and the current remuneration of gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities; it is also responsible for certain aspects of conditions for access and connection to the electricity and natural gas distribution and transmission networks, and the rules for the operation of the organised markets as regards their regulated component.  Furthermore, in the context of the current energy transition, it is necessary to adopt a clear, stable and predictable regulatory and institutional framework that provides legal certainty to natural and legal persons related to the energy sector; this framework should apply to both vulnerable groups and national and international investors. Therefore, the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law 1/2019 also provides that, prior to the approval of the circulars, MITECO may issue a report on the appropriateness of the proposal in relation to the energy policy guidelines established by the Government, as well as the mechanisms for cooperation with the CNMC in the event of disputes. Indeed, effective cooperation is the key to the development of a clear, stable and predictable regulatory and institutional framework and to providing coherent signals to operators, consumers and investors, in order to achieve the objectives set out in the Clean Energy for All Europeans regulatory framework and in this Plan.  In accordance with the amendments introduced by the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law, in Article 3 and Article 16 of Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013 on the Electricity Sector:   The General State Administration will be responsible for regulating the structure of the charges for regulated costs and the charges necessary to cover other electricity system costs. 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 32   MITECO, following an agreement of the Government Delegated Committee for Economic Affairs, will make the necessary arrangements to set the necessary charges, which will be established in accordance with the methodology foreseen to cover the costs of the relevant activities of the system.   Following a report from the CNMC, the Government will establish the methodology for calculating the charges to be paid by consumers and, where appropriate, by electricity producers. The charges will cover the systems costs determined, without prejudice to the provisions for transmission and distribution tariffs.  Finally, it should be noted that both Royal Decrees are going through parliament; they should regulate the methodology for calculating charges in the electricity and hydrocarbon sectors and establish the variables used to distribute these costs, to ensure that distribution is not discriminatory and complies with the energy policies promoted by the Government. In other words, they should promote efficiency, the decarbonisation of the economy and a just energy transition.   Research, innovation and competitiveness  The MCI is the department of the General State Administration responsible for implementing policy on scientific research, technological development and innovation in all sectors. For this reason, it is responsible for implementing RIC policy in the energy sector and coordinating all the involved agents.  The framework for action in the field of research, development and innovation is defined in two key documents on science, technology and innovation policy: the Spanish Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2013-2020 (EECTI) and the State Plans for scientific and technical research and innovation.  The Spanish Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2013-2020 (EECTI) is the instrument that sets out the general objectives to be achieved during the 2013-2020 period relating to the promotion and development of RDI activities in Spain. These objectives are in line with those established by the European Union within the framework programme for financing RDI activities Horizon 2020-2020, helping to encourage the active participation of the actors of the Spanish Science, Technology and Innovation System in the European area. It also includes coordination between the actions of the General State Administration, the autonomous communities and the European Union, at the same time as proposing efficient mechanisms of coordination between the actors of the abovementioned Spanish Science, Technology and Innovation System.  The EECTI establishes priority areas that cover the entire process of development and application on scientific and technical research, technological development and innovation concerning major challenges for Spanish society: health; ageing; the implementation and upholding of the principles of inclusion of the most fragile segments of our society; environmental sustainability; resilience to climate change; energy supply; biodiversity; the transformation of our political and social systems; and the safety of our citizens.  One of the objectives of the EECTI is to guide RIC activities, including fundamental scientific and 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 33 technical research, technological development and innovation, towards eight major areas that involve important markets for the development of new products and services: 1. Health, demographic change and well-being; 2. Food security and quality; productive and sustainable agricultural activity; sustainability of natural resources, marine and maritime research; 3. Safe, sustainable and clean energy; 4. Intelligent, sustainable and integrated transport; 5. Action on climate change and efficiency in the use of resources and raw materials; 6. Social change and innovation; 7. Digital economy and society; 8. Security, protection and defence.  The State plans for scientific and technical research and innovation, which were prepared by the MCI, with contributions from public research centres, universities, technology centres, business associations, technology platforms and experts from the scientific, technical and business community, are the specific implementation of the abovementioned Strategy 2013-2020. The 2017-2020 Plan (PEICTI 2017-2020), which was approved by the Council of Ministers in December 2017, as well as the plan covering the 2013-2016 period, is made up of four state programmes that correspond to the general objectives established in the Strategy: the promotion of talent and employability; the generation of knowledge and strengthening of the system; business leadership in RDI; and RDI aimed at the challenges facing society.  -2020, the Spanish Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and the State plans for scientific and technical research and innovation jointly define the national framework for smart specialisation (RIS3), on which the autonomous communities base their research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation.  The Spanish Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2013-2020 is supplemented with sectoral policies. In this regard, coordination is established with the Spanish Strategy for climate mitments on climate change and promoting clean energies while improving social welfare, economic growth and environmental protection.  Spain is undergoing a cost-effective energy transformation that allows it to achieve the European targets for GHG emission reduction and decarbonisation of the economy, in accordance with the -which ensures supply and economic growth in Europe, with research and innovation as one of its fundamental pillars.  The SET Plan plays a major role in this process. In September 2015, the Communication from the Commission  proposed 10 key actions in line with the priorities of the Energy Union and its fifth pillar on research, innovation and competitiveness. The proposal sought a definitive change in the concept of the European energy system, proposing an integrated system that would move beyond the silos of energy technologies which had been the focus previously.  Spain also cooperates with other Member States through transnational technology cooperation programmes:   Eureka, and bilateral cooperation programmes, in which the participation of Spanish companies is financed by the CDTI, by means of loans with a non-reimbursable instalment 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 34 through a non-competitive call that is open all year round.  Eurostars, for R&I-intensive SMEs. The CDTI provides funding via subsidies in a competitive call for applications. It has set closing dates.  ERA-Net Cofund scheme, which allows different types of entities to participate in competitive calls for proposals and funds them through grants. It has set closing dates.  Horizon 2020, open to participation by all types of entities. Annual competitive calls for proposals with set closing dates and funding via grants.  Research and innovation policies are proposed and implemented by the units responsible for funding activities proposed by the Ministry. The Spanish Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and its State Plans for RDI are used in implementing them. These include activities such as:  The AEI, which was created by Royal Decree 1067/2015 of 27 November 2015 with the aim of being the instrument used to modernise public management of state R&D policies in Spain, is responsible for financing, evaluating, awarding and monitoring scientific and technical research activities. The AEI manages the following programmes of the State Plan: the State programme for the promotion of talent and its employability; the State programme for knowledge generation and institutional and technological strengthening; and the State RIC Programme aimed at societal challenges.  The CDTI, a public business entity, which also functions under the MCI, aims to increase the competitiveness of Spanish companies by raising their technological level. It carries out activities to finance business RIC projects (State Programme for Business Leadership), as well as projects to manage and promote Spanish participation in international technological cooperation programmes and support for the creation and consolidation of technology-based companies.  In addition, the main bodies focused on implementing actions subsidised by the AEI are the Public Research Bodies, such as the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) or the CIEMAT, which are attached to the MCI. Among the actions of the AEI, Technological Platforms are particularly important. These are forums for teamwork, led by the industry, which integrate all the agents of the Science-Technology-Innovation system (companies, technology centres, public research organisations, universities, R&I centres, associations, foundations, etc.), with the main objective of defining the short, medium and long-term vision of the sector and of establishing a strategic RIC path. Their objectives include:   encouraging competitiveness, sustainability and growth in the industrial sector and the Spanish scientific-technological sector;  being a mechanism of RIC transfer to the national and international market;  directing the creation of jobs and innovative companies through projects and actions.  Finally, the non-profit energy initiative, ALINNE, should be mentioned. This initiative was created to combine and coordinate efforts among all the agents in the energy RIC value chain, in order to respond to the main challenges for RIC policy in the energy sector, thereby contributing to the definition of work guidelines at national level and a European position.
