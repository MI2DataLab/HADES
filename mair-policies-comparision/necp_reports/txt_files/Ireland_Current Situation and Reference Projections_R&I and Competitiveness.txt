4.6. Dimension Research, Innovation and Competitiveness i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) The SEAI Low Carbon Technologies team provides energy/low carbon technology sector market support and technology-related policy support to DCCAE. It covers areas such as wind & electricity, heat & bioenergy, solar, ocean and smart grids. The group develops technology roadmaps (informed by SEAI modelling), promotes the growth of relevant supply chains, represents Ireland in technology fora, develops guidance relevant to technology sub-sectors for suppliers, installers, manufacturers and consumers, and supports critical supply chain development, often in collaboration with partner state agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland (IDA Ireland) and Enterprise Ireland.   207 SEAI, in partnership with Irish enterprise state agencies the Industrial Development Authority Supply Chain Opportunity in 2014. The analysis estimated that the total average annual investment required in sustainable energy technologies and services in Ireland up to 2020 in  of total annual expenditure was expected to be in the energy efficiency c to  in renewable energy technologies and  in development of the electricity grid infrastructure. The analysis found that over 70% of the total anticipated expenditure in the energy supply chain up to 2020 was estimated to be within areas of the supply chain where Irish organisations are very well positioned or well positioned to capture investment in goods and services markets. The existing Irish supply chains in these areas did not foresee any significant barriers to expanding their business as the market grows. However, the report found that some support may be needed to help them maintain competitive advantage; for example, continued RD&D supports, financial supports, investment in training, and support for export market development. SEAI conducted a technology mapping exercise in 2019, mapping the current position of energy/low carbon technologies against a selected number of EU comparator countries. The following countries were chosen for the comparison: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia and United Kingdom. The rationale for choosing these comparator countries was as follows:  8 potential comparator countries selected for indicator collection after excluding countries with the following characteristics: o <=20% or >=500% the size of Ireland in terms of population, area, and GDP o Forecast % increase in Renewables between 2017 and 2030 <=5%  o GDP per capita <=15,000 Euros in 2017  neighbouring country and has a similar legislative landscape  At EU level, Ireland is ranked 20th by population numbers but second on a GDP per services. However, from an environmental and energy analysis Ireland is ranked 26th in the EU for emissions per capita and 15th for renewables penetration. Four of the eight comparator countries reduced their GHG emissions below the 2017 interim target, whilst four did not. Three of these countries need to make the largest % reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. Table 38 shows the percentage renewable energy achieved by each country by 2017   208 and calculated by the Effort Sharing Regulation Formula for 2030. It also shows the greenhouse gas reductions targeted and achieved by 2017 and targeted in 2030. Table 38: Country Comparison of RES and GHG Member State Percentage Renewable Energy Percentage GHG Emissions Reduction %RE in 2017*  (Achieved) %RE in 2030 (ESR Formula) %GHG Emission in 2017 (Interim Target) %GHG Emission in 2017 (Achieved) %GHG Emission Target in 2030 (ESR)  Austria 32.6 46 -13 -10 -36 Belgium 9.1 25 -10 -10 -35 Czech Rep 14.8 23 -6 -4 -14 Denmark 35.8 46 -19 -13 -39 Finland 41 51 -11 -9 -39 Ireland 10.7 31 -13 -6 -30 Netherlands 6.6 26 -11 -21 -36 Portugal 28.1 42 -1 -14 -17 Slovakia 11.5 24 -9 -14 -12 United Kingdom 10.2 27 -14 -21 -37  According to the European Innovation scorecard, measures, on a yearly basis, the innovation performance of Member States, drawing on statistics from a variety of sources, Ireland is considered a strong innovator, above the EU average index and ranked 10th. Relative to other comparator countries, Ireland is ranked 7th out of the 10 selected comparator countries. Table 39 summarises average innovation performance of each comparator country using a composite indicator called the summary innovation index. Summary Innovation Index, which is a composite indicator obtained by taking an unweighted average of the 27 indicators.  Ireland is the strongest in Impacts Area which looks at employment impacts and sales impacts Employment impacts measures the impact on employment and includes two indicators measuring employment in knowledge-intensive activities and employment in fast-growing firms in innovative sectors. Sales impacts measures the economic impact of innovation and includes three indicators measuring exports of medium and high-tech products, exports of knowledge-intensive services and sales due to innovation activities.    209 -range in the Framework Conditions section which is comprised of three indicators. The Human resources dimension includes three indicators and measures the availability of a high-skilled and educated workforce. Attractive research systems includes three indicators and measures the international competitiveness of the research base by focusing on international scientific co-publications, most cited publications, and foreign doctorate students. Innovation-friendly environment captures the environment in which enterprises operate and includes two indicators, Broadband penetration among enterprises and Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship, measuring the degree to which individuals pursue entrepreneurial activities as they see new opportunities. Ireland has the highest level of completed third-level education in the EU. Whilst the data indicate that the ratio of doctorate graduates to third-level graduates is somewhat lower, it is still relatively high in the EU context and when compared to the selected comparator countries. Ireland has a highly-skilled and educated workforce, complementing the focus on high-value products and service seen above in the impact area.  Investments captures investments made in both the public and business sector and differentiates between two innovation dimensions: Finance and support includes two indicators and measures the availability of finance for innovation projects by venture capital expenditures, and the support of governments for research and innovation activities by R&D expenditures in universities and government research organisations. Firm investments includes three indicators of both R&D and Non-R&D investments that firms make to generate innovations and the efforts enterprises make to upgrade the ICT skills of their personnel. Ireland scored below the EU average on this and is ranked 6th amongst the comparator countries, signifying a below average level of investment in RD&D.  Innovation activities captures different aspects of innovation in the business sector and differentiates between three dimensions: Innovators includes three indicators measuring the share of firms that have introduced innovations onto the market or within their organisations, covering both product and process innovators, marketing and organisational innovators, and SMEs that innovate in-house. Linkages includes three indicators measuring innovation capabilities by looking at collaboration efforts between innovating firms, research collaboration between the private and public sector, and the extent to which the private sector finances public R&D activities. Intellectual assets captures different forms of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) generated in the innovation process, including PCT patent applications, Trademark applications and Design applications. Ireland scored relatively high for innovators but low for, linkages and intellectual assets, again reinforcing the point of having a high-skilled, highly educated workforce that do not go on to pursue research activities, but innovate out in the field and supply chains.   210 Table 39 provides a composite indicator (comparison index from 0 to 1) for each of the comparator countries. The colour indexing indicates the lowest performing (red) to the highest performing (green) across each indicator.

The individually analysed technologies are shown in Table 40 using a traffic light system. High (Green) indicating either full or comprehensive focus on the technology areas across the four-research programme/policy areas (NECP, SETPlan, IEA TCP or Mission Innovation). Medium (orange) indicating participation or focus in a number of those programme/polices, low (red) indicating a limited focus. It is important to note that this analysis was carried out based on the best available data and therefore it is highly likely that in a number of cases, countries will have a Research, Innovation or Competitiveness focus on technology areas which was not apparent as part of this analysis.

Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers A key metric for the assessment of innovative activity is R&D intensity (R&D expenditure as a percentage of GNP) which reflects the extent of research and innovation activities undertaken in a country in terms of resources input. 1.84% of GNI. The Europe 2020 strategy (a 10-year strategy developed by the European Commission in 2010) sets a 3% objective for R&D intensity. The Irish Government has adopted an R&D intensity target for Ireland of 2.5% of GNP to be achieved by 2020. A three-year averagapproximate level of annual public investment in energy RD&D. There is a shared vision of continuing to develop the Irish energy research, development & demonstration community to one which is considered to be world class.    213 Ireland has one of the lowest levels of general R&D expenditure relative to selected comparator countries on the basis of public expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP as shown in the Table 42. The table also shows the level of R&D expenditure by which countries are targeting by 2020. It shows the target set by Ireland (2%) is below the level set by most of the selected comparator countries.

For example, the support scheme for renewable heat (SSRH) funded by DCCAE and administered by SEAI and other similar schemes provide market support activation to assist the deployment of technologies within a particular sector. The table below shows that Ireland ranks 7th out of the 10 selected comparator countries for State Aid for environmental protection as a proportion of GDP.

Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies)  The tables below provide details on the electricity and gas price components for household and non-household consumers for 2018 based on data from the Eurostat databank. Price components are broken down into those associated with energy & supply; network costs; taxes, fees, levies & charges; value added tax; renewable taxes; capacity taxes; environmental taxes; nuclear taxes and other costs. In the second semester of 2018 household electricity prices in Ireland increased by 12%, while household gas prices increased by 21%. Electricity Price to Business Table 47 shows the disaggregation of electricity prices to business (non-household) weighted across all consumption bands for 2018.  The energy and supply component in Ireland was 7.95 c/kWh or 57% of the total price. This was the third highest in Europe after Malta and Cyprus  Network costs accounted for 31% of the price or 4.33 c/kWh in absolute terms. This was the highest in Europe  Renewable energy taxes accounted for 6.9% of the price or 0.96 c/kWh. This was the 13th highest in Europe   217  Environment taxes accounted for 0.4% of the electricity price to business in Ireland and ranked 16th highest in Europe Table 47: Electricity price breakdown to business in Ireland in 2018 (c/kWh) Energy & Supply Network Costs Renewable Taxes Capacity Charges Environment Taxes Other 7.95 4.33 0.96 0.33 0.05 0.25  Electricity Price to Households Table 48 shows the disaggregation of electricity prices to household weighted across all consumption bands for 2018.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy has been in place since 2001. It is the overall support mechanism for peat generation, for certain conventional generation constructed for security of supply purposes, and for the development of renewable electricity. The levy compensates electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.    219 This levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020. This is important for Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (as amended) provide the legal basis for the levy. The levy applies to all electricity customers and is reviewed annually. It should be noted that PSO levy supports for peat generation ceased at the end of 2019.  As part of the Climate Action Plan, it is planned to carry out an assessment of the impact of the current structure of electricity bill charges, including PSO charges on consumers, in 2020. Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) will provide support to renewable electricity projects in Ireland. With a primary focus on cost effectiveness, the RESS will deliver a broader range of policy objectives, including:  An Enabling Framework for Community Participation through the provision of pathways and supports for communities to participate in renewable energy projects  Increasing Technology Diversity by broadening the renewable electricity technology mix (the diversity of technologies)  Delivering an ambitious renewable electricity policy to 2030  Increasing energy security, energy sustainability and ensuring the cost effectiveness of energy policy RESS auctions will be held at frequent intervals throughout the lifetime of the scheme. This will allow Ireland to take advantage of falling technology costs and by not auctioning all the required capacity at once; Ireland will not be 'locking in' higher costs for consumers for the entirety of the scheme. The Scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of up to a maximum of 55% by 2030 subject to determining the cost-effective level. RESS auctions will be designed in line with trajectory targets identified in Ireland's NECP. In addition, the first RESS auction will deliver 'shovel ready' projects, reducing the gap to 2020 targets and assisting in the early qualification will be accepted in March 2020, with the auction bidding process to commence in Summer 2020.    220 Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) is a government funded initiative designed to increase the energy generated from renewable sources in the heat sector. The scheme is open to commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating, public sector and other non-domestic heat users. The primary objective of the support scheme for renewable heat is to increase the level of renewable energy in the heat sector. renewable energy targets whilst also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The government funded scheme will support the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating, public sector and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the emissions trading system. The scheme aims to bridge the gap between the installation and operating costs of renewable heating systems and the conventional fossil fuel alternatives; and incentivise the development and supply of renewable heat.  The scheme opened for applications relating to installation grants for air source heat pumps, ground source heat pumps and water source heat pumps in September 2018. The operational support component of the scheme opened in June 2019, including support for biomass boiler/biomass HE CHP heating systems and biogas (anaerobic digestion).  illion was paid in environmental subsidies and similar transfers to Irish corporations, households and public bodies, as well as to international environmental organisations under Irish government commitments. This was 31% higher than the amount paid in 2016 but  provided in 2008.  Environmental protection activities were subsi, or 59% of the total, , or 41%, was used to support resource management activities. In 2016, 31% of environmental transfers went to renewable energy production, 26% to wastewater management, 23% to biodiversity protection and 9% to heat and energy saving measures. Other activities, such as waste management and protection of air and climate, accounted for the remaining 10%. The largest subsidy to renewable energy generation in 2017 was worth  and came from funds collected through the PSO (Public Service Obligation) Levy on electricity consumers.  In the previous 2016 statistical release by the CSO referred to above, provisional data was provided on Potentially Environmentally Damaging Subsidies (PEDS) or other Government support measures that have social or economic objectives which may also incentivise behaviour that could be damaging to the environment. For example, transport fuel tax rebates encourage the consumption of fossil fuels. Table 51 provides details of the   221 Potentially Environmentally Damaging Subsidies provided by the Irish Government in 2016. The data indicate that 75% of environmental subsidies provided in Ireland are directed to Potentially Environmentally Damaging Subsidies. Table 51: Potentially Environmentally Damaging Subsidies (2016) Programme   Agricultural product subsidies: cattle  55,900 PSO Levy: electricity generation from peat 115,400 Fuel allowance  230,921 Electricity allowance  150,729 Gas allowance  19,193 Other supplements (including heating and diet) 3,347 Petroleum Infrastructure Support Group 191 Haulier's diesel rebate scheme 1,300 Total Potentially Environmentally Damaging Subsidies (2016) 576,981  Agricultural Product Subsidies: Agricultural subsidies on products are paid per unit of a good produced, e.g. per head of cattle. Many agricultural product subsidies have been phased out and have been replaced by direct payments to farmers such as the Single Payment Scheme. PSO (Public Service Obligation) Levy: The PSO Levy is charged to electricity consumers in Ireland and is used to subsidise electricity generation from peat and renewable sources as well as for security of supply. The statistical release includes the portions that go towards electricity generation from peat and security of supply as PEDS while the portion that supports electricity generation from renewable sources is included as an environmental subsidy. Fuel Allowance: The Fuel Allowance Scheme was introduced in 1988. The aim of the scheme is to assist qualified households in receipt of certain social welfare payments with their heating costs. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. Electricity Allowance: The electricity allowance is part of the Household Benefits Package which is available to all householders over 70 and to householders under 70 in certain circumstances.   222 Gas Allowance: The gas allowance is part of the Household Benefits Package which is available to all householders over 70 and to householders under 70 in certain circumstances. Other supplements (including Heating and Diet): This is a supplement paid by the Department of Social Protection and the Social Insurance Fund as an income support measure. The statistical release includes 50% of the amount of funding as an estimate of the proportion that went to heating rather than food support. Petroleum Infrastructure Support Group: Annual contributions to this fund are made by companies with licences for hydrocarbon exploration and development activities off the Irish coast. The fund is administered by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and its aims are to enhance understanding of the relatively underexplored Irish offshore through funding of new research and data collection activities. the tax that they pay on diesel purchased for use in the course of business. As a first step in relation to plans to phase-out energy subsidies, the Climate Action Plan commits to model the impacts, both in terms of the economy and in terms of emissions, of removing fossil fuel subsidies.
