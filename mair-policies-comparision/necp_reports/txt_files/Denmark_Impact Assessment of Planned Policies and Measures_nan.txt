        175  5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES66  5.1 Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and greenhouse gas emissions and removals including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4) The projections in this NECP, described in Chapter 4, are done on the basis of existing policies and measures, including initiatives in the most recent Energy Agreement of June 2018. These projections equal those published in the Danish Energy And Climate Outlook in September 2019. On 27 June 2019 a new Government took office, launching climate change as one of its main priorities. On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle. The Government will, inter alia, propose climate action plans, which will launch new initiatives contributing to meeting the ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target. At the time of the submission of the National Energy and Climate Plan, these initiatives, however, have not yet been proposed or developed to an extent, where they can be being  adopted and implemented after the date of submission of the integrated national energy and cli.  Consequently, no analysis has been made of the impacts of planned policies. Impact assessments of planned policies will be provided in progress reports, as appropriate, and as requested by the Governance Regulation.                                                               66 Planned policies and measures are options under discussion and having a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented after the date of submission of the national plan. The resulting projections under section 5.1.i shall therefore include not only implemented and adopted policies and measures (projections with existing policies and measures), but also planned policies and measures.         176  5.2 Macroeconomic, and to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts including just transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures  The green transition will require changes in and by the entire society, including changes that have economic and social consequences for society, companies and individuals.  Denmark is well aware of this, and it is an objective of the Danish Government to make the transition fair, just and equitable. One result of this effort is the export of energy technology. In 2017, Danish exports of energy technology and energy services amounted to 85 billion DKK, which was 11.1 % of overall Danish exports of goods and services. Half of this export was green technologies. The green transition, hence, contributes significantly to Danish economy. Another aspect of the green transition can be seen in the employment statistics. In 2015, 72,000 people were full-time employed within the energy sector, of which 41 % within the green energy sector. This was expected in the previous Energy Agreement from 2012. The green transition creates green jobs. Moreover, these green jobs are located in many different parts of Denmark, thereby supporting a geographically inclusive growth.  Looking ahead, the latest Energy Agreement of June 2018 likewise focuses on promoting Danish knowledge and Danish energy solutions globally, as ever more countries pursue a transition to green energy. Denmark intends to seize these opportunities through efforts such as bilateral collaborations with public authorities in other countries, thereby paving the way for other countries to benefit from Danish experiences and possibly also benefit Danish green exports (for more information see section 3.5). Public awareness of climate change and energy issues has never been bigger. This is crucial to the choices to be made by all citizens. The Energy Agreement includes a reduction of energy taxes aimed at encouraging more people to choose green solutions such as heat pumps. This would also benefit society moving towards a flexible and integrated energy system and better utilisation of surplus heat in an energy system with a high share of fluctuating energy. The tax reductions will also reduce energy costs for Danes Competences and skills needed for the green transition are not the same as for a society based on fossil fuels. This is reflected in the educational system on all levels from primary school to universities, where the green transition has triggered a change in study programmes unseen a decade ago. The Danish Energy Agency has implemented different initiatives for the purpose of improving the skills and quality regarding installation of energy-related product in buildings. In 2008, the Agency established an information center for energy savings (https://www.byggeriogenergi.dk). The content of information in the information center is         177  targeted installation contractors. Furthermore, the Danish Energy Agency has a certification scheme for installing small renewable energy plants as part of the implementation of the EU-directive for renewable energy. Moreover, the agency and Danish Standards have recently developed a national standard that when published is expected to improve energy efficiency in heat pump installations. In regard to health the projections of air pollutants shows an overall decrease in air pollutants emissions towards 2040 (for more information see section 4.2.1). This is expected to have a positive impact on the general health in society.             178  5.3 Overview of investment needs (i) existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures Denmarks shift towards a greener energy system was most recently promoted with the Energy Agreement of 2018. The accumulated public and private investments flows initiated by the Energy Agreement is estimated in the range of DKK 100-180 billion DKK until 2030  or approximately DKK 10 billion annually. The estimated investments flows can be divided into the main categories listed in Table 20 below. Table 20. Estimated public and private investment flows from 2018-2030 following the Danish climate and energy targets by 2030.  Estimated investment flows, by sector (2018-prices, DKK billion) Sector of investment Investment description Investment value Households Energy efficiency and conversion of heat supply 20 - 30 Industry Energy efficiency and new technology 10 - 30 Electricity New renewable energy capacity installed 60 - 90 Gas and district heating Biogas and new district heating capacity 10 - 30 Total accumulated  100 - 180   Note: The estimates of expected investments flows are associated with considerable uncertainties. The specified  intervals do therefore not necessarily represent the entire spand of possible investment outcomes. The estimation metodology of investment flows is based on expected installed volumes in the different categories and the corresponding expected unit prices. In addition to the estimated investments driven by a shift towards a greener energy  supply, there will be other indirect "base load" investments associated with e.g. the conversion of power plants, as well  as investments in district heating, gas and electricity transmission network which could amount to around DKK 5 billion  annually.   The source of funding related to the above investements flows will in part come from both public and private capital. In particular, private capital is expected to constitute a substational proportion of the funding as industry investments mostly are financed via capital from private financial institutions and investments funds. In terms of public sources of funding, future state budget laws will be implemented according to the agreed multi annual budget of the 2018 Energy Agreement, which is reproduced in Table 21.              179  Table 21. Prioritised budgets 2018-2025 in the 2018 Energy Agreement. The agreement prioritises approximately 0.5 billion DKK in 2019, increasing to approximately 2.8 billion DKK in 2025.           180  Note: Due to rounding, there may be deviations between the sum of the components and the total sum. The tax reductions so includes derived lower tax revenue. In addition, on December 2 2019 the Danish Government, its supporting parties and the Alternative reached agreement on the Finance Act 2020. The parties agreed to establish a new fund called nd, which will manage a total of 25 billion DKK. The fund will contribute to the green transition in Denmark and abroad.  (ii) Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context Being a subsection of section 5.3 it is assumed the information to be reported here is information on sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context in relation to investment needs. As mentioned in chapter 5.3(i) information both public and private investments are available for this reporting. The risk factors or barriers in the national context in relation to the investment needs relate to the budgets for achieving the objectives in the 2018 Energy Agreement. However, as announced in the 2018 Energy Agreement, progress with implementation of adopted measures will be closely monitored through frequent stock-takes and follow-ups. The risk factors or barriers in the national context in relation to the investment needs will be minimised as any gaps in the need for additional public finance support or resources will be identified well in advance through the frequent stock-takes and follow-ups. (iii) analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under point (ii) With the Energy Agreement being adopted in 2018 analyses with a view to identify gaps in the need for additional public finance support or resources have not yet been relevant. As for financial support regarding private investment, Danish pension funds have recently announced that they plan to invest DKK 350 billion by 2030 in an effort to support the green transition.            181  5.4 Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures  Nordic Energy Research, the platform for cooperative energy research and policy development reporting to the Nordic Council of Ministers and funded jointly by the Nordic governments, published Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives 2016 together with the International Energy Agency in 2016  a report looking at regional long-term, cost efficient, low-carbon technology pathways for the Nordic region. This study presents a detailed scenario-based analysis of how the Nordic countries can achieve a near carbon-neutral energy system by 2050 (the Carbon Neutral Scenario, CNS) and compares this to a Nordic 4 Degrees Scenario (4DS) reflecting the Nordic contribution to the I-degrees scenario.  Thus, giving general information on how a Nordic cooperative approach towards near carbon neutrality could:  i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible  ii. Impacts on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration iii. Where relevant, impacts on regional cooperation The analysis in NETP 2016 is based on a scenario where Nordic energy-related CO2-emissions fall by 85% by 2050. The name the Carbon-Neutral Scenarioreflects the wording used in official targets, although carbon neutrality requires offsets to be used for the remaining 15%. Thus, the CO2 reduction pathway established in the NETP CNS scenario should be viewed as a minimum requirement. To enable the world as a whole to limit global warming to 1.5°C, as stated in the Nordic Prime Minister Declaration on Nordic Carbon Neutrality from January 2019, it is likely that additional abatement measures will be required. After completing two editions of Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives (NETP), a tracking report has been made to illustrate how the Nordics progress towards a carbon neutral society. The result is Tracking Nordic Clean Energy Progress 2019; a brief, illustrative report that tracks the Nordic progress towards a carbon neutral society by highlighting the larger trends and by diving into cases where Nordic solutions could have a global impact. The report was launched in October 2019.   Some of the major findings of this study are that:  For the period 2013 to 2016 the Nordic countries are on track to meet the carbon neutral pathway, even with higher GDP growth than expected, but it is likely that additional measures will be necessary to continue this trend.         182   The positive development is mainly driven by the power and district heat sector which are delivering substantial CO2-emission reductions, falling from 60.7 MtCO2 in 2007 to 37.4 in 2016, in line with the intermediate CNS 2030 target of 19.2 MtCO2.  The Nordic countries have, in aggregate, seen the renewable energy share of total primary energy demand rising from 29% in 2006 to 39% in 2016 (+10 percentage points in 10 years).  The electric vehicle share of the light-duty vehicle stock are on track to the 2020 CNS target of 4.1%.  Looking at the challenging sectors, the study finds that:  Energy consumption and emissions in the industry sector have gone down, but hard to abate process emissions remain.   Energy efficiency in buildings is economical, but hard to realise   Bioenergy should be used in high-value sectors (transport), and sustainability remains a challenge.   CCS needs to be demonstrated at scale.
