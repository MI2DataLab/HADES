131 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   4.2 Decarbonisation Dimension 4.2.1 GHG emissions and renewals i. Trends of current GHG emissions and removals in EU ETS, distribution of effort and LULUCF sector and different energy sectors  Total emissions The total GHG emissions since 2005 for each sector are shown in the figure below. In Slovenia, we emitted 17 453 kt CO2 eq in 2017. Transport is the largest sector with 32%, followed by the transformation sector with 31%, industry with 17% (industry and construction and industrial processes), agriculture with 10%, general consumption with 8% and waste with 3%. Sinks from LULUCF accounted for 9% of total emissions in 2017.  Figure 22: Trend of GHG emissions in the period 2005-2017  Key to Figure 22:  GHG emissions  LULUCF  Waste  Agriculture  General consumption  Transport  Industry  Transformations ESD emissions (non-ETS) Decision No 406/2009/EC imposed an obligation on Slovenia not to increase its GHG emissions from the ESD sectors (non-ETS emissions) by 2020 by more than 4% compared to the 2005 level. In addition to the final target, the Decision also lays down a method for determining annual emission allocations (target values) for the initial year of the period 2013-2020 and the intervening years (proposal of the third annual report on the implementation of OP TGP 2020). Slovenia is meeting its annual targets. Emissions from ESD sectors in 2017 amounted to 10 883 kt CO2 eq., which is 11% less than the limit value. These emissions accounted for 62% of total GHG emissions, the remaining 38% are emissions from sources included in the allowance trading scheme (the EU-ETS system). The third annual report on the implementation of OP TGP 2020 indicates that the volume of sinks has remained at approximately the same level in the recent period. Since a forest inventory was carried out in 2018, the third annual report is, of course, linked to past trends. Sinks have fallen sharply in the last five years, to almost zero, mainly due to increased sanitary felling. 132 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 23: Trends in emissions from ESD sectors (non-ETS) over the period 2005-2017  Key to Figure 23:  GHG emissions for non-ETS (ESD)  LULUCF  Waste  Agriculture  General consumption  Transport  Industry  Transformations Figure 24: ETS sector emissions trends 2005-2017  Key to Figure 24:  GHG ETS emissions  LULUCF  Waste  Agriculture  General consumption  Transport  Industry  Transformations ETS emissions The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions covered by the EU-ETS scheme increased by 1.4% in 2017 compared to 2016 and were down 24.9% compared to 2005. The upward trend was seen again after years of decline in 2016. Industry (industry and construction; energy use of fuels and industrial processes) accounts for about 27% of all ETS emissions, the rest (73%) is attributed to transformations with fugitive emissions. GHG emissions not covered by the EU-ETS scheme (ESD emissions) decreased by 2.8% in 2017 compared to 2016 and were down 10.8% compared to 2005. After three years of decline, the upward trend was seen again in 2015. Transport accounts for around 51% of total emissions from ESD sectors. The annual sectoral fluctuations observed in the total emission balance are reflected only in 133 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   transport, the reason being that, except for transport, no other ESD sector represents more than 16% in the balance. Transport Total GHG emissions in 2017 amounted to 5 541 kt CO2 eq73. In the period 19862017, emissions increased by 174%. In 2017, road transport emissions accounted for 99.3% of all emissions in the transport sector, while other forms of transport (rail, aviation, other) represented less than 1% of transport emissions. In 2017, emissions decreased by 3.4% compared to the previous year, despite increased activity in the sector - an increase in passenger and freight kilometres, therefore the reason for the decrease lies in particular in the reduced volume of sales of vehicle fuel in Slovenia, as vehicle fuel prices were some of the highest among the neighbouring countries.  Figure 25: Analysis of the evolution of GHG emissions in transport during the period 1986-2017  Key to Figure 25: Y-axis: GHG emissions X-axis: Base emissions  Road transport  Railways  Domestic air transport  Other transport Industry In 2017, GHG emissions from the combustion of fuel in manufacturing, construction and industrial processes totalled 2 887 kt CO2 eq74. In the period 1986-2017, emissions decreased by 50%, with combustion emissions reduced by 62% and process emissions by 10%. In 2017, process emissions accounted for 42% of total emissions from the manufacturing and construction sectors. The reduction of GHG emissions is the result of various factors, notably environmental commitments, carbon levy and emissions trading, implementation of energy efficiency measures, use of renewable sources, improvements in industrial production processes and restructuring within individual industries. The figure below shows the downward trend in GHG emissions in manufacturing and construction in the period 1986-2017. The figure below shows a breakdown of energy consumption and CO2 emissions (excluding indirect emissions from electricity consumption) in manufacturing by sector for 2017.

We can see that the largest share of final energy consumption results from the manufacture of basic metals (C24, 28%), manufacture of paper and paper products (C17, 13%), manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products (C23, 13%), and manufacture of chemicals and chemical products (C20, 9%), with other sectors accounting for around 37%. Figure 26: Analysis of GHG emission trends in manufacturing and construction in the period 1986-2017  Key to Figure 26: Y-axis: GHG emissions X-axis: Base emissions  Emissions from fuel use  Process emissions The largest share of CO2 emissions in manufacturing and construction (excluding indirect emissions from electricity consumption) results from the manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products (39%), manufacture of basic metals (21%), manufacture of paper and paper products (13%) and manufacture of chemicals and chemical products (5%). Other sectors combined account for around 22% of emissions in manufacturing and construction.

In the period 1986-2017, emissions decreased by 40%, with emissions from services decreasing by 44%, those from households by 35% and those from agriculture by 50%. In 2017, emissions in services represented 25% of total emissions in the buildings sector, households 58% and agriculture 17%. The reduction in GHG emissions is the result of various factors, in particular environmental commitments, imposition of the carbon levy and emissions trading as well as the implementation of energy efficiency measures, the use of renewables, improvements in industrial production processes and restructuring of individual industrial sectors. Compared to 2016, emissions fell by 8.2% in 2017. In the period 2005-2017, general consumption emissions decreased mainly due to investments in improving the thermal characteristics of buildings and other energy efficiency measures, as well as the replacement of fuel oil.

Projections of developments in sectors with existing national policies and measures and Union policies and measures until at least 2040 (including 2030)  The total GHG emissions in the projections in both scenarios are lower. In the existing measures scenario, they are minimally reduced after 2017, with a reduction of 18% in 2030 compared to 2005, and, in the ambitious NEPN scenario with additional measures, emissions are reduced by 36%. Compared to the baseline emissions used for the Kyoto Protocol, emissions are reduced by 17% in the EM scenario by 2030 and by 36% in the NEPN scenario. In 2040, in the NEPN scenario, emissions are reduced by 67% or 69%, depending on the scenario. There are fewer emissions in the nuclear development scenario and more in the synthetic gas development scenario. Below, only the results of the synthetic gas development scenario are shown for 2035 and 2040 because there are more emissions.                                                            75  National GHG inventories - Greenhouse gas emissions by major source group, source: ARSO, 2018. http://okolje.arso.gov.si/onesnazevanje_zraka/vsebine/toplogredni-plini.  136 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 29: Projection of total GHG emissions by 2040 for the existing measures scenario and for the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 29:  GHG emissions [kt CO2  LULUCF  Waste  Agriculture  Wide use  Transport  Industry  Transformations Table 46: Total GHG emissions in Slovenia by 2030 by scenarios   2005 2017 2020 2025 2030 Reduction 2005 EM [kt CO2 eq] 20 519 17 453 17 084 16 904 16 860 -18% NEPN [kt CO2 eq]  17 453 16 660 15 719 13 089 -36% Non-ETS emissions follow a similar course to total emissions, except that the reduction is less. The main source of emissions is transport, which contributes to more than half of the total emissions. By 2030, this share increases to 60% under the EM scenario and 56% under the NEPN scenario. In 2030, in accordance with the EM scenario, emissions are reduced by 10% compared to 2005 and, in accordance with the NEPN scenario, by 25%. The Regulation on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States in the period 2021-2030 sets a 20% reduction target for Slovenia for 2030; this is achieved and exceeded by the NEPN scenario. 137 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 30: ESD (non-ETS) projection of GHG emissions by 2040 for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 30:  GHG emissions for non-ETS (ESD) [kt CO2  LULUCF  Waste  Agriculture  General consumption  Transport  Industry  Transformations  Figure 31: Projection of ETS sector GHG emissions by 2040 for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario   Key to Figure 31:  GHG ETS emissions  [kt CO2  LULUCF  Waste  Agriculture  General consumption  Transport  Industry  Transformations  138 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Emissions in the ETS sector under the EM scenario increase up to 2035, mainly due to the increase in emissions in the transformation sector. By 2030, in the existing measures scenario, ETS sector emissions are reduced by 28%. In the NEPN scenario, they are reduced by 51% by 2030 thanks to TE unit 5 ceasing operation and by 79% by 2040 thanks to the possible introduction of CCS technologies at TE unit 6 after 2035. Below we provide projections for the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. The EM scenario covers the measures and policies adopted at the time of projection, assuming that they are implemented at a similar rate of development up to 2050. The maximum forestry felling value is gradually increasing, reaching at least 6.5 million m3 in 2020. The remediation of forests damaged in natural disasters and due to bark beetle predation in 2014-2018 is expected to be completed in 2023. The scenario envisages the implementation of measures in accordance with the strategies adopted for the LULUCF sector (e.g. NGP, AN OVE, AN URE, SDS, PRP, etc.). The demand for timber and the quantity and composition of harvested timber products corresponds to the trends of previous years. It seems that timber market stakeholders do not change their habits. The rate of overgrowth due to the abandonment of agricultural activity is approximately equal to the rate of deforestation, which means that the forest area remains unchanged. Land-use trends remain the same as in previous years. While mechanisation in agriculture is gradually increasing, no significant impact on the reduction of emissions due to technological advances is expected in future. Common agricultural policy measures and world market prices are major drivers of the LULUCF sector.  Figure 32: Past net emissions and projection of net emissions in the LULUCF sector for the two scenarios (EM and NEPN)  Key to Figure 32: GHG emissions and removals  Actual development  EM  NEPN In the NEPN scenario, active forest management continues, but greater investment is needed in forest regeneration and tree composition changes. The share of spruce is decreasing, especially in areas of beech habitat, and the share of artificial restoration is increasing. Production periods of key tree species are becoming shorter, and forests rejuvenation periods are becoming shorter. The trend of population growth, economic growth and productivity continues. Food self-sufficiency is increasing, mainly due to the increase in the agricultural area utilised. At regional and local level, there is a greater emphasis on efficient land use and optimisation of spatial plans. The state is devoting more resources to investing in innovation and technological development. Some additional measures relevant to reducing emissions in the sector are under preparation. 139 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Table 47: Sources of GHG emissions in Slovenia not included in ETS by 2030 according to scenarios   2005 2017 2020 2030     EM NEPN EM NEPN Transport [kt CO2eq] 4 416 5 541 5 781 5 700 6 357 4 965 General consumption [kt CO2eq] 2 661 1 456 1 267 1 186 784 620 Agriculture [kt CO2eq] 1 709 1 688 1 747 1 730 1 796 1 695 Waste management [kt CO2eq] 848 557 460 460 275 275 Industry [kt CO2eq] 1 542 1 132 1 185 1 218 985 875 Energy [kt CO2eq] 591 509 456 569 405 401 Total [kt CO2eq] 11 767 10 883 10 895 10 863 10 602 8 830         4.2.2 Renewable energy In the area of RES development, Slovenia is required to achieve the specified targets for both 2020 and 2030 which will contribute to increasing the security of the energy supply, to reducing environmental impacts, to economic growth, job creation and employment. i. The current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in these sectors Slovenia achieved a 21.04% share of renewables in 2017 and a 21.14% share in 2018, falling short of the target. The share of renewables, amounting to 1 085 ktoe (12 617 GWh), was chiefly the result of the use of renewables for the production of heat (58%), renewable electricity generation (40%) and the use of biofuels in transport (2%). The share of households in renewable heat production amounted to 85%, the share of industry to 14% and the service sector to only 2%. Gross final energy consumption in 2017 was 5 051 ktoe (58 742 GWh). The largest share of gross consumption was in the transport sector (36%), 37% in the heating sector and 26% in gross electricity consumption. Figure 33: Structure of gross final energy consumption and RES in 2017  Key to Figure 33: Structure of the gross consumption of final energy  Transport Gross electricity consumption Structure of gross RES use  Gross heat consumption  households Gross electricity consumption Transport Gross heat consumption  Total heat 58% Gross heat consumption  households Gross heat consumption  industry Gross heat consumption  services  Total heat 37%  140 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Sectoral shares in 2017 were:  32.4% share of RES in gross electricity consumption,  33.2% share of RES in gross heat consumption,  2.6% share of RES in transport. The share of RES in electricity and heat production is therefore very similar and the share of RES in transport is significantly smaller, which means that the faster increase in energy use in transport compared to the other two sectors reduces the total share of RES in gross final energy consumption. In the heat sector, there are significant differences in the share of RES for industry, households and services. The share of RES in industry is 11.3%, in households 60.7% and in the services sector 8.8%. Figure 34: Sectoral shares of RES for 2017  Key to Figure 34: RES sectoral shares Electricity Heat Transport Heat - industry Heat - households Heat - services  In transport, renewable electricity use contributes 33% to the share of RES, the remainder coming from the use of biofuels. The 2.6% share of renewables in transport is calculated using multipliers as defined in Directive (EU) 2015/1513 (the ILUC Directive). In the period 2012-2017, renewable electricity generation increased by 449 GWh. This was mainly due to the construction of two new hydro-electric power sed production increase of 304 GWh, while during this period the 15-year average of operating hours decreased by 1.2%. The increase in the capacity of solar power plants during this period led to a 121 GWh increase in renewable electricity generation. There were also increases in electricity generation from wind power (6 GWh) and wood biomass (41 GWh), while generation from biogas decreased by 23 GWh. As renewable electricity generation increased, at the same time gross electricity consumption also increased, specifically by 1 029 GWh in the period 2012-2017. Growth in industry (524 GWh) and in the service sector (356 GWh) contributed most to this. The share of renewable electricity increased from 31.6% to 32.4%. 141 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 35: Comparison of change in RES electricity production (left) and gross electricity consumption (right) in 20122017  Key to Figure 35: Electricity production from RES Gross electricity consumption  Biogas  Solid biomass   PV  Wind power plants [VE]   Hydro-electric power plants [HE]  Own use, losses  Services   Households   Transport  Industry In the period 2012-2017, the use of renewables in the heat sector increased by 123 GWh. Wood biomass consumption in industry rose by 332 GWh while, on the other hand, wood biomass consumption in households fell by 497 GWh as a result of energy efficiency measures in buildings. There was, however, an increase (of 211 GWh) in the use of environmental energy in households due to an increase in the use of heat pumps replacing fossil fuel boilers and wood biomass boilers. In households, the use of solar energy by means of solar collectors also increased (by 14 GWh). In the services sector, statistics cover only the use of biogas, which in the period monitored decreased (by 15 GWh), and direct use of geothermal energy, which increased by 2 GWh. The use of renewables increased by 333 GWh in industry, fell by 273 GWh in households and fell by 12 GWh in services. District heating production from RES increased by 75 GWh. In the period 2012-2017, gross heat consumption decreased by 858 GWh. The largest contribution to this came from the household sector, where heat consumption decreased by 1 293 GWh, while in services it decreased by 67 GWh and in industry increased by 503 GWh. Own use and losses were minimally reduced (by 1 GWh). With regard to the data for the service sector, it should be noted that the statistics for this sector are incomplete, as  with the exception of biogas and the direct use of geothermal energy  the use of renewables is not recorded, which means that the observed decrease in energy use for heat in the period monitored may be overestimated and be due to the replacement of fossil fuels with RES. The share of RES in heat increased from 31.5% in 2012 to 33.2% in 2017. 142 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 36: Comparison of changes in RES use in the heat sector (left) and gross consumption heat (right) in 2012-2017  Key to Figure 36: Renewable heating consumption Gross heating consumption  DH from RES  Environmental Energy   Solar   Biogas  Wood biomass  Own use, losses  Services   Households   Industry In the period 2012-2017, the use of liquid biofuels in transport dropped by 312 GWh, mainly due to the lower percentage of biofuels blended into petrol and diesel. In the mixed fossil and bio fuel components of petrol and diesel, biofuels accounted for 2.7% in 2012 and only 1.2% in 2017. Total energy consumption in transport increased by 448 GWh. In addition to biofuels, the use of electricity in transport is taken into account when the share of RES in transport is calculated. The statistics showed that electricity was used in rail and cable car transport and, in 2017, the consumption of electricity in road transport started to be monitored. Renewable electricity consumption increased by 25 GWh in the period 2012-2017. The total share of RES in transport, taking into consideration some multiples of RES consumption, dropped from 3.3% in 2012 to 2.6% in 2017. 143 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 37: Comparison of change in liquid biofuel consumption in transport (left side) and energy consumption in transport (right side) in the period 2012-2017  Key to Figure 37: Biofuel consumption Energy consumption in transport   Biofuels  Transport Figure 38: Comparison of shares of RES per sector with the development scenarios indicated in the Renewable Energy Action Plan [AN-OVE] in the year 2010  Key to Figure 38: RES share [%]  RES - Electricity  RES - Heat and cooling   RES - Transport  RES - Total  Electricity - AN OVE   Heat and cooling - AN OVE  Transport - AN OVE  Total - AN OVE Comparison of the sectoral shares of renewables [RES] and the total share of renewables with the projected development indicated in the 2010 Renewable Energy Action Plan [AN-OVE] shows that in 2017 only the share of renewables in heat and cooling exceeds the predicted development, while all other shares are less than predicted. The share of renewables in heating and cooling is significantly higher than the projected development due to improvement of the statistical monitoring of RES consumption in households, whereby it was found that the use of RES in households is significantly higher than estimated. The share of renewable electricity was below the trajectory in 2015, when electricity consumption started to increase but renewable electricity generation did not. The share of renewables in transport started to decline in 2014 when the subsidisation of biofuels was discontinued. As from 2017, distributors are entitled to a supplement to the price of fuel for blending, 144 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   and a new Decree on renewable energy sources in transport (Uradni List RS ([UL RS; Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia] No 64/16) has been adopted which defines methods and action to comply and check compliance with the obligations of fuel distributors in terms of placing biofuels and other RES on the market. Article 4 of the Decree requires fuel distributors, in the sale of fuel and electricity for use in transport in a given calendar year, to achieve the renewable energy share in transport specified in the Renewable Energy Action Plan 2010-2020, the total renewable energy shares in transport per individual years being as follows: at least 6.20% in 2017, at least 7.00% in 2018, at least 8.40%in 2019 and at least 10.00% in 2020. ii. Indicative projections of developments with existing policies for 2030 (with outlook until 2040) Dispersed renewable electricity generation is an important pillar of future sustainable and self-sufficient electricity generation which will complement production in larger generation facilities on the transmission network. Solar energy The generation of electricity in solar power plants (SPP) represents the greatest developmental and environmentally acceptable potential for increasing renewable electricity generation in Slovenia. In terms of sustainable use of space, it is rational to steer future development towards the priority of integrating solar energy into buildings, where technical electricity generation potential with regard to the available surface area is estimated at more than 20 TWh, the key limitation being the capacity to integrate solar power into the electricity grid, which, apart from the costs of power plants, is a crucial economic criterion for the development of solar power plants76.  In the solar power plant development scenarios studied, different intensities of SPP development are analysed, which increase electricity generation from solar power plants to between 0.6 and 1.9 TWh (between 492 MW and 1 650 MW) by 2030 and to between 0.9 and 5.4 TWh (between 742 MW and 4 400 MW) by 2040. Up to 2030, this would require from 20 to 125 MW of SPP capacity to be installed annually, including approximately 80% are medium- and large-sized solar power plants (100 and 600 kW, a smaller proportion of free-standing SPPs of 1 000 kW on degraded or industrial sites), with the remainder being SPPs for self-supply in households. Figure 39: Development of solar power plants [SPP] - installed capacity and electricity generation for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 39:   Actual development  NEPN  EM                                                            76  From the network perspective, it is far easier to incorporate larger solar power units at locations with higher electricity consumption (all consumed on-site) or by connecting to the medium-voltage network. 145 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   The table below gives an overview of the generation of electricity in solar power plants (SPP) by year for the period 2017-2040. Table 48: Generation of electricity in solar power plants (SPP) in the period 2017-2040  Unit 2017 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 EM scenario GWh 284 306 427 556 724 904 NEPN scenario GWh 284 420 981 1 866 3 404 5 361 Wind energy With regard to wind power plants, we have the problem of siting them spatially (areas classified as secured, protected and endangered areas) and in terms of social acceptability (due to dispersed settlement, there is a limited number of locations with appropriate wind conditions where in the vicinity there are no people or noise issues). Consequently, in the wind power development scenarios analysed, we remain within the potential of 415 MW, as estimated when the Renewable Energy Sources Action Plan [AN-OVE] was revised in 201577. Figure 40: WPP development - installed capacity and electricity generation for the scenario with existing NEPN measures and scenario  Key to Figure 40:   Actual development  NEPN  EM The table below gives an overview of wind power generation in wind power plants (WPP) by years for the period 2017 to 2040.

The NEPN therefore adheres to the Aquarius78 study guidance that, with a view to minimising negative impacts on nature, the small hydro-electric power plant network should, as far as possible, be developed by prioritising the upgrading and modernising of existing, already functioning sHPPs and the revitalisation of existing, non-functioning sHPPs in preference to the installation of new sHPPs, which should be linked to existing structures (dams and barriers) on watercourses. In the small hydro-electric power plant development scenarios analysed, existing capacity (155 MWe) is expanded to a lesser extent79 to 159 MWe by 2030 and to 177 MWe by 2040. This would represent an increase in current electricity production (383 GWh in 2017) to around 395 GWh in 2030 and up to 440 GWh in 2040, which is within the planned range indicated in the revised Renewable Energy Action Plan [AN-OVE].

The increase in hydro-electric power in the NEPN figures up to 2030 envisages an increase in the generation of electricity at existing and other permitted sites in line with legislation.

Wood biomass The exploitation of sustainably available wood biomass (preferably wood processing industry residues, logging residues, etc.) is focused primarily on the gasification of wood biomass for the production of synthetic gas and hydrogen and injection into the gas pipeline network in order to minimise the number of energy conversions and minimise losses of available biomass potential, and co-generation of electricity and heat in industry, district heating systems and services, where by utilising the available heat we can achieve maximum total yields. The Slovenian Forest Service estimates that , in 2020, logging of lower quality wood (excluding logs) will amount to 3 800 000 m3, including 2 200 000 m3 deciduous wood and 1 600 000 m3 conifer wood This wood is suitable for energy use, and poor-quality round wood can also be used for the production of particle boards and fibre boards, mechanical pulp, insulation boards and chemical products. Given                                                            80 The dotted line shows the possible development of the exploitation of hydro potential. 148 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   the strategic orientations that give absolute priority to the processing of wood into products, it will be possible to use only part of this potential for energy production. The needs of the wood processing industry for low-quality round wood are expected to increase to 1 098 000 m3 by 2020, including 360 000 m3 of deciduous wood and 738 000 m3 of coniferous wood (net volume). In 2017, according to the latest estimates (source: GIS), we used 980 000 m3 of wood (net volume) for these purposes. Based on the data on possible logging of poor-quality wood (excluding round wood) and on the basis of the estimated needs for poor quality round wood, it was estimated that 2 300 000 m3 of forest biomass could be used in 2020, including 1 800 000 m3 deciduous wood and 500 000 m3 of coniferous wood. The estimated quantities are more than 70% higher than estimated in the Renewable Energy Action Plan [AN OVE]. The latter calculates that, in 2020, the direct supply of wood mass from forests will be 1 338 000 m3, which is only about 20 000 m3 more than in 2006. The potential to generate energy from forest biomass is estimated at 6 598 GWh of heat and 326 GWh of electricity. This will contribute most of the heat (over 90%) and about a third of the electricity from agriculture and forestry. In the distribution of energy to thermal and electrical, the same ratio was observed as in the Renewable Energy Action Plan (94.9: 5.1). Promoting co-generation while providing useful use of the heat is one of the measures necessary for the more efficient use of wood biomass. In large thermal power plants, biomass is used in addition to the basic energy source; wood chips as a renewable source are used in the production of heat and electricity. Annual biomass consumption for these purposes fluctuates and reached 96 kt in 2017, generating up to 190 GWh of thermal energy and up to 50 GWh of electricity. Biomass is becoming competitive with imported coal for heat and electricity production, but its use is limited to co-incineration on an existing coal plant and not on its own. Biogas Due to the relatively well-developed livestock breeding, livestock manure presents considerable potential for biogas production. A theoretical calculation shows that 315 GWh of electricity and 245 GWh of heat could be produced from the manure of cattle, pigs and poultry, and this raw material is also suitable for the production of biogas, which is a renewable gas and, in purified form, suitable for injection into gas networks and, as such, able to replace natural gas. Because farms are relatively small and geographically spread out, only about one-third of this potential is technically usable and, currently, rough estimates suggest that 0.2% of cattle manure potential, 13.8% of pig manure potential and 5.8% of poultry manure potential are used. In the analysed scenarios for the development of electricity production from all types of biogas, the existing capacity (31 MWe) is increased to a smaller extent - up to 34 MWe by 2030 and up to 41 MWe by 2040. This would represent an increase from the current electricity production (127 GWh in 2017) to up to 170 GWh in 2030 and up to 245 GWh in 2040. These could be biogas production sites or biogas gas purification and injection and production in another location, it being especially necessary to utilise the available heat where and to the extent possible. The total biogas production potential is thus around 480 GWh in 2030 and up to 700 GWh in 2040. This includes biogas production from sewage treatment plants, waste treatment and landfill gas capture and agricultural gas production, with the main crops not being used, being aware that agricultural land is intended for food production. 149 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 43: Development of exploitation of biogas (from agriculture, waste water treatment, waste and landfill gas) - installed capacity and electricity generation under the EM and NEPN scenarios  Key to Figure 435:   Actual development   EM   NEPN  The table below shows electricity production from biogas by years for the period 2017-2040.

This involves harvesting residues, wood biomass of permanent crops and wood biomass of borders between parcels and overgrown agricultural land. The potential presented therefore does not include energy from wood waste and waste wood products. Nor does it assess the potential for bioethanol production, which - in terms of raw materials - is in direct competition with biogas. If bioethanol production were to be planned, the production of electricity and heat from biogas would have to be reduced. The fact that the potential of these renewable energy sources is not evaluated does not mean that they may not be the recipients of incentives.
