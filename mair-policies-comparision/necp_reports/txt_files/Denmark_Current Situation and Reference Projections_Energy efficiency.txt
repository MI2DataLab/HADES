        152  4.3. Energy efficiency (i) Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport)  The trends in primary and final energy consumption in the economy from 2005-2040 are shown in Figure 34 below.   The figure shows that in 2017:  Primary energy consumption was 18.131 ktoe   Final energy consumption was 14.863 ktoe  Ratio between primary energy consumption and final energy consumption was 0,81  Figure 34. Primary and final energy consumption 2005-2040 [ktoe]       Figure 35 shows the trends in final energy consumption by sector from 2017-2040.   The figure shows that the transport (35 %) and the residential (31 %) sector acounted for the largest shares of the final energy consumption in 2017.   The share of final energy consumption in the other sectors in 2017 was:   industry 15%   tertiary 13%   agriculture 5%   construction 1%           153    Figure 35.

(ii) Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling A comprehensive assessment of the potential for the application of high efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling in Denmark was delivered to the Commission in December 2015 in accordance with article 14, 1 in Directive 2012/27/EU.  The technical potential of district heating is expected to increase by 1194 ktoe in 2035. The business economic potential is expected to reach 3583 ktoe in 2020, which is an increase by ~1433 ktoe compared to 2013 (Energi, 2015).   The socio economic potential is expected to increase from ~1911 ktoe in 2013 to 3105 ktoe in 2020. From 2020 to 2030 the analysis shows that socio economic potential district heating potential decreases to around 2388 ktoe.   The potential for combined heat and power in Denmark is expected to decrease from covering 73 % of the district heating demand in 2012 to covering 63 % in 2025 as a result of the integration of RES-electricity sources in the electricity grid.   The combined heat and power have relatively high marginal costs compared to e.g. wind and PV, and are therefore estimated to be less feasible in the future energy system in Denmark. When there is reduced market incentive to produce electricity from the combined heat and power it is more economic feasible to only invest in heat producing units. The decrease in combined heat and power is not substituted by thermal power production, but by intermittent renewable energy share and renewable energy district         154  heating technologies. There are no national strategies to change this development as the energy security level is high in the Danish electricity grid (99.99 %) and because there are several renewable energy share alternatives to produce heat for district heating grids.   The district cooling potential is not expected to change dramatically in the period 2006-2030 and it is expected to reach 2,866 MW. The socio economic potential is 2,211 MW and therefore it is almost corresponding to the technical potential.  (iii) Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)53 Section 4.3(i) showed the current primary and final energy consumption. This section describes the projections from 2017-2040, shown in the figures presented in the section 4.3(i).  Figure 34 shows the development in primary energy consumption, final energy consumption and ratio from 2017-2040. The projection shows that:  Primary energy consumption increases 1% from 2017 to 2030 and decreases 1% from 2017 to 2040  Final energy consumption increases 6% from 2017 to 2030 and 8% from 2017 to 2040  ratio increases 5% from 2017 to 2030 and 9% from 2017 to 2040   Figure 35 shows final energy consumption by sector from 2017-2040. A key result of the projection is that only the residential energy consumption is expected to fall, while for the other sectors energy consumption is expected to stay at roughly the same level. The largest increase in energy consumption is expected in the tertitary sector, particularly due to (COWI A/S for the Danish Energy Agency, 2018). However, there is still considerable uncertainty associated with projecting electricity consumption by large data centres.  The concrete results of the projections are:   agriculture increases 2% from 2017 to 2030 and 5% from 2017 to 2040   construction increases 6% from 2017 to 2030 and 8% from 2017 to 2040   industry increases 6% from 2017 to 2030 and 12% from 2017 to 2040   residential decreases 5% from 2017 to 2030 and 10% from 2017 to 2040  tertiary increases 44% from 2017 to 2030 and 73% from 2017 to 2040   transport increases 2% from 2017 to 2030 and to decreases 2% from 2017 to 2040   Moreover, Figure 35 shows the share by sector of final energy consumption (FEC) in 2030 and 2040. The projection shows that:  agriculture accounts for 5% of FEC 2030 and FEC 2040                                                            53 This reference business as usual projection shall be the basis for the 2030 final and primary energy consumption target, which is described in 2.3 and conversion factors.         155   construction accounts for 1% of FEC 2030 and FEC 2040   industry accounts for 15% of FEC 2030 and FEC 2040   residential accounts for 27% of FEC 2030 and 26% of FEC 2040   tertiary accounts for 18% of FEC 2030 and 22% of FEC 2040   transport accounts for 34% of FEC 2030 and 32% of FEC 2040 (iv) Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU Denmark has submitted the latest cost-optimal report to the Commission on March 23, 2018. The cost-optimal report shows the following overall conclusions: In general, the overall level for requirements for new buildings is a little tighter than what is required by the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The weighted average for new buildings shows that the Danish requirements are 21 % tighter than the cost-optimal level. However, there are variations between different types of buildings. For building elements that are subject to a renovation, the requirements are also near the cost-optimal point. The calculations show variations for different types of constructions depending on the starting point of the insulation levels of the existing constructions.  For buildings undergoing major renovation, the building regulations include renovation classes that can be used. The levels in these classes have been evaluated in the cost-optimal report, and the report showed that the level was not sufficiently tight. The weighted average showed that the requirement in average was 30 percent from the cost-optimal point. After the cost-optimal report was published, the levels of the renovation classes have been lowered. The renovation classes, therefore, are now within the cost-optimal range. Overall, the report shows that Denmark fulfills the requirements of cost-optimal levels in building regulations.
