 4.2 Dimension: decarbonisation 4.2.1. GHG emissions and removals  i. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors Total GHG emissions were 41 037.12 Gg CO2 (without LULUCF) in 2016. This represents a reduction of 44.5% compared to the 1990 reference year. Compared to 2015, emissions increased by 0.3%. Total GHG emissions in the Slovak Republic increased in 2016 compared to the previous year, caused by an increase in the industrial processes sector, in the agricultural sector, as well as in response to economic growth in Slovakia. This trend was slightly corrected by a year-on-year increase in capture in the LULUCF sector. The greatest changes in the national emission inventory (submitted in 2018) are due to a recalculation of the emissions in the transport, agriculture, LULUCF (and KP LULUCF) and in the waste sector for individual years or whole time series. Emissions without LULUCF increased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015. In the 1991-2016 period, total greenhouse gas emissions in the Slovak Republic did not exceed the 1990 level. Figure 13 shows - in an assessment relative to 1990 (100%)  trends in gases in relation to the Kyoto Protocol target without LULUCF. The consumption of HFCs, PFCs and SF6 gases in industry result in emissions collectively called F-gases. Despite the decline, PFCs from aluminium production show a rising trend. Figure 13 Trends in greenhouse gas emissions (relative as %) relative to the KP target  Source: SHMI Key: Kyoto Protocol target CO2 CH4 N2O GHG F-Gases  The Slovak Republic reduced its emissions by approximately 17% between 2008 and 2016. According to emission projections (2017), Slovakia is on track to exceed its 2020 target compared to 2005 by 17%. The reduction in emissions to 2005 was thanks to several impacts, starting with industrial and technological restructuring linked to the transition from fossil fuels from coal and oil to natural gas  (the main driver has been legislation on air pollution since 1991). After 2005, emissions reduction has been mainly achieved by restructuring the economy in a less-energy-intensive direction and also temporary changes in production intensity (in relation to global and EU markets). The transport sector (especially road transport) is showing ever-increasing emissions. In Slovakia, the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy through the implementation of new technologies will take longer, especially in combination with the high dynamics of energy-intensive industry. There is continued pressure to develop effective strategies and policies to achieve a further reduction in emissions. One example is a combination of regulatory and economic instruments (tolls for trucks based on their environmental characteristics in combination with fuel and emission standards for new vehicles). The trends observed in energy consumption can be partly explained by the economic crisis. Besides this, structural changes in the manufacturing industry towards less-energy-intensive industries such as engineering and the automotive industry can explain why after 2009 energy consumption did not grow at a similar pace as in the previous year, leading to a significant reduction in primary consumption. The trend recorded mainly in primary energy consumption is therefore mainly due to other factors, although some improvements in energy efficiency were made, primarily in the 2005-2008 period. Figure 14: Total GHG emissions (in Gg of CO2 equiv.) per capita  Source: SHMI As of 31 December 2016, the population of the Slovak Republic was 5 435 343. The average population density is 110.8 inhabitants per kmÂ². The population is concentrated in towns and lowlands and basins, while the hills and mountains are thinly populated. The average unemployment rate in the Slovak Republic was 5.8% in the first half of 2019 (based on data from the SO SR). The City of Bratislava is the largest city in the Slovak Republic with a population of 425 932 (as at 31 December 2016). Total anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without LULUCF fell by 45.2% in 2016 compared to the baseline year (1990). In 2016, total CO2 emissions were 33,996.77 Gg without LULUCF. Compared to 2015, this is a 1% increase. The reason for the increase in CO2 emissions in 2016 was mainly the increase in CO2 emissions in industrial processes and waste as a result of increased economic output. In 2016, CO2 emissions, including LULUCF, were comparable to the previous year and had dropped by 48.3% compared to the baseline year.  Total anthropogenic emissions of methane without LULUCF decreased by 39.1% compared to the baseline year (1990) and currently their value is 4 383.52 Gg CO 2 equiv. In absolute terms, CH4 emissions were 175.34 Gg without LULUCF. Methane emissions from LULUCF represent 0.76 Gg, caused in particular by forest fires. This trend has been relatively stable over the last five years, with a slight decline in 2014 due to an increase in emissions from the energy sector. CH4 emissions reached a new maximum in 2002 (since 2000) and have been declining since then thanks to the implementation of new legislation on waste.  Total anthropogenic emissions of N2O without LULUCF decreased compared to the baseline year (1990) by 56.0% and currently their value is 1 971.15 Gg CO2 equiv. Emissions of N2O in absolute value reached 6.61 Gg without LULUCF. N2O emissions from LULUCF were 0.12 Gg. Emissions rose by 1% compared with 2015 due to increased activity in the industrial processes sector. The trend is related mainly to the production of nitric acid. The overall decrease in these emissions is related to the decline in agricultural production due to the decreasing number of animals and use of fertilisers.  Total anthropogenic emissions of F-gases were 673.37 Gg HFC, 6.49 Gg PFC and 5.82 Gg SF6  in CO2 equiv. Since 1995, HFC emissions have increased as a result of increased consumption and substitution of PFCs and CFCs. Since that year, it has declined for the first time in the last inventory year (2016). This decrease applied to all F-gases and is a consequence of the implementation of F-Gas EU legislation. The PFC emission trend is decreasing and SF6 emissions increased slightly due to an increase in industrial consumption.  Figure 15: Trends in GHG emissions between 1990 and 2016 by gas relative to 1990 levels (100%)  Source: SHMI  The energy sector, including transport, was the main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions with a 67% share in 2016. The share of the transport sector (16%) in total emissions decreased by 1% compared to the previous year (2015). In addition to combustion in stationary pollution sources, pollution from small sources and residential heating systems as well as fugitive emissions of methane from transport, and the processing and distribution of oil and natural gas, significantly contribute towards total greenhouse gas emissions. Next in order of importance is the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector, accounting for 23% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. This sector mainly produces technological emissions  from raw materials processing, chemicals production and steel and iron production. Reducing emissions from technological processes is very costly, partly due to the existence of specific technical limits, so emissions from the reference year have not changed as significantly as in other categories.  The fastest growing emissions in the IPPU sector are emissions of HFCs and SF6 due to industrial demand and the use of these substances in the construction, insulation, electrical and automotive industries.  In 2016, the share of the agricultural sector in total greenhouse gas emissions was 6%. The trend in emissions has remained relatively stable since 1999. The most significant reduction in emissions from agriculture was achieved in the early 1990s as a result of a reduction in livestock breeding combined with reduced use of fertilizers.  In 2016, the waste sector contributed 4% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Utilizing a more accurate methodology for assessing methane emissions from solid waste in landfills and the inclusion of the older layer in the calculation resulted in a continuous increase in emissions of over 100% compared to the 1990 base year. A similar trend is anticipated in the coming years, although this increase should not be as significant as before. The amounts of emissions from landfills depend largely on the applied methodology for landfill assessment, as well as on the extent to which landfill site operators use energy recovery from landfill gases.  The share of individual sectors in total greenhouse gas emissions has not changed significantly compared to the 1990 base year. However, an increase in transport emissions and a decrease in the share of stationary sources of pollution in the energy sector are noticeable. Combustion of fossil fuels, which account for approximately 75% of total CO2 emissions in the Slovak Republic (excluding LULUCF), is the most important anthropogenic source (see Figure 16).  Figure 16: Share of individual sectors in total GHG emissions      Source: SHMI  Key categories are defined as emission sources or capture that have a significant impact on inventory as a whole, in terms of absolute emission levels, the trend or both. CO2 emissions from category 1.A.3.b - Road transport - diesel are the largest key category, responsible for 24% of total CO2 emissions without LULUCF in 2016. Between 1990 and 2016,  emissions in road transport increased by 1.5 Mt CO2, an increase of 30% due to the increase in fossil fuel consumption in this key category (Figure 17). Since 1990, the largest increase in CO 2 emissions has been identified as related to road transport. Figure 17 below shows that solid fuels from category 1.A.1 Fuel combustion is the second largest key category without LULUCF (17%), although between 1990 and 2016 emissions in this category dropped by 35% The main factors explaining this decrease in emissions are improvements in energy efficiency and the transition from coal to gas. CO2 emissions in category 2.C.1 - Iron and steel production is the largest key source without LULUCF in the industrial process and product use (IPPU) sector and accounts for 16% of total CO2 emissions in 2016. CO2 emissions from category 1.A.2 in the energy sector are the third largest source in the Slovak Republic, accounting for 17% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. Between 1990 and 2016, emissions from this category dropped by 50%  Figure 17: Absolute change in CO2 emissions for key categories between 1990 and 2016  Source: SHMI Methane emissions account for 9% of total GHG emissions in 2016 and have fallen by 39% since 1990 to 175.34 Gg CH4. The two largest key sources (5.A Solid Waste Disposal with 22% and 3.A Enteric fermentation with 22% of total CH4 emissions in 2016) account for 50% of CH4 emissions in 2016. Figure 18 shows that the main causes of the decline in CH4 emissions, the reduction in the enteric fermentation category due mainly to the declining number of animals and reduced emissions in the categories of fugitive emissions from coal mining. Figure 18 also shows a significant drop in categories 3.A and 3.B and an increase in Category 5.A - Solid waste landfills (due to the change in IPCC methodology used for landfills, considering the time layer since 1960. Figure 18 Absolute change in CH4 emissions for key categories between 1990 and 2016 5.D Wastewater Treatment and Discharge 3.D.1 Direct N2O Emissions From Managed Soils 2.B.2 Nitric Acid Production 3.B Manure Management 3.D.2 Indirect N2O Emissions From Managed Soils 5.B Biological Treatment of Solid Waste 2.G Other Product Manufacture and Use  Total N2O Gg CO2 equiv. Source: SHMI N2O emissions account for 4.9% of total GHG emissions and have fallen by 56% to 6.61 Gg N2O in 2016 (Figure 19). This trend was caused by a decline in the two largest key sources: 3.D.1 - Direct N2O emissions from agricultural soils with a 52% share and 3.D.2 - Indirect N2O emissions from agricultural land with a 16% share of total N2O emissions in 2016. The main reason for the large reductions in N2O emissions was the application of reduction measures in nitric acid production processes and a slowdown in agricultural activities (Figure 19). N2O emissions increased in category 5.B - Biological waste treatment. This increase was due to increased operations and output. Figure 19 Absolute change in N2O emissions for key categories between 1990 and 2016 5.D Wastewater 3.D.1 Direct N2O Emissions From Managed Soils 2.B.2 Nitric Acid Production 3.B Manure Management 3.D.2 Indirect N2O Emissions From Managed Soils 5.B Biological Treatment of Solid Waste 2.G Other Product Manufacture and Use Total N2O Gg CO2 equiv. Source: SHMI Emissions of fluorinated gases account for 1.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, emissions were 679.86 Gg CO2 equiv., which was 146% higher than 1990 levels. The largest key source is category 2.F.1 - Cooling and Air Conditioning and accounts for 93% of fluorinated gas emissions in 2016. HFC emissions from the use of halogenated hydrocarbons have grown significantly between 1990 and 2016. The main cause was the elimination of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol and the replacement of these substances with HFCs (mainly in cooling, air conditioning, foam production and as aerosol propellants). On the other hand, PFC emissions have decreased significantly. The decline began in 1996 and was strongest in 1999 and 2000. The area of forest land reached 2.019 million ha, of which stands covered 1.946 million ha. Since 1990, the area of forest land has increased by 42 700 ha and stands by 24 600 ha. The timber stock on forest land increased from 348.5 to 480.3 million m3 raw wood without bark. The area of forest stands on non-forest land increased from 273 000 to 288 000 ha and timber stocks from 38 to 46 million m3. The total forested area of the Slovak Republic, calculated from stands, is 45.1%. At present, due to the current age composition, wood reserves are at the highest they have been for at least the last century. The same statement applies to non-forest land. Dead wood is an important component of forest ecosystems to promote biodiversity, and should be kept in forests to an extent appropriate to its functional focus. There is currently 87.0 million m3 of  dead wood on forest land and 6.8 million m3 in stands on non-forest land. Converted per hectare, these figures are significantly higher than the European average. This situation is mainly due to the deteriorated condition of forests after a wide range of calamities and insufficient stand hygiene. The decomposition of dead wood is also a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The state of forest stands has an impact on the balance of greenhouse gas emissions and capture. The significant scope of calamities and the rapid aging of the remaining stands have reduced the capture possibilities after 1990 from approx. 8 500 Gg to the current 4 500 to 5 500 Gg per year. The most important carbon storage in forest stands is living biomass, the amount of which depends on the maintenance of or increase in the production capacity of the forests. With regard to the impact of climate change, it is also necessary to improve the age structure of the forests by gradually decreasing the area of older stands with decreasing production capacity. In 2015, the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic drew up and submitted to the Government of the Slovak Republic the Waste Management Programme 2016-2020 (WMP SR), which is prepared in accordance with the requirements laid down in the legislation of the Slovak Republic and the European Union (EU), especially in Act No 223/2001 on waste and on amendments to certain other Acts, as amended, and Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council No 2008/98/EC of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives. The WMP SR defines the objectives for individual waste streams resulting from EU legislation as well as the legislation of the Slovak Republic. On 5 December 2018, the MEnv SR submitted to the Government of the SR information on the ongoing fulfilment of WMP SR objectives and measures for the 2016-2020 period, in which it evaluated the fulfilment of the set strategic goals and targets in the recycling of individual waste streams, stating that in 2017 the objectives relating to the landfilling of all waste, the landfilling of municipal waste and the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste were not met, and will not be met in the coming years. These waste streams are an important source of energy that is being landfilled today. It is therefore desirable to set up State policies and regulatory mechanisms to limit landfilling so that part of the waste will be recycled and part for energy recovery in accordance with waste management priorities. ii. Projections of emissions sectoral developments with existing national and EU policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for 2030)  scenario with measures - WEM ii-a) Description of the scenario with measures (WEM) - GHG emission projections were prepared according to the WEM scenario, which is equivalent to the EU 2016 reference scenario (EU 2016 RS) for 2015-2040 (with a view to 2050). 2016 was designated as the reference year for the modelling of greenhouse gas emissions for all scenarios for which verified data sets from the national greenhouse gas emission inventory were available. The scenario is based on the logic of the EU 2016 RS and includes policies and measures adopted and implemented at EU and national level by the end of 2016, including measures needed to achieve the renewable energy and energy efficiency targets in 2020. Policies included in the EU 2016 RS also include amendments to three directives agreed at the beginning of 2015 (ILUC - Renewable Energy Directive, FQD - Fuel Quality Directive and the EU ETS Market Stability Reserve Decision), but do not take into account the results of the negotiations relating to the Clean Energy for All Europeans, or the measures taken at national level after 2016 (including the decision to phase out support for electricity generation from domestic coal by 2023). The scope of the EU 2016 RS includes currently known policies and any additional measures necessary to achieve binding energy and climate targets to 2020. After 2020,  other policy measures are excluded from the EU 2016 RS, except for the EU ETS. The pricing trajectory for EU ETS quotas draws on the EU 2016 RS quota price outlook. Despite the absence of new policies after 2020, the reference scenario is not a frozen efficiency outlook. Energy efficiency improvements in all sectors will continue in the future, albeit at a slower pace than would be the case with the enactment of new policies. EU energy efficiency directives already in place and regulations for the ecological design of household appliances, motors and other electrical equipment will have an increasing impact. Most importantly, market forces are the drivers for efficiency gains. In industry, progress in energy efficiency is part of the pursuit of productivity growth, which is part of sustained growth in added value. In the building and transport sectors, energy efficiency improvements are achieved through the commercialisation of equipment and vehicles with increasing efficiency, as industry considers operating cost reductions to be a marketing factor that can increase sales. Therefore, the decoupling of energy consumption from economic growth will continue in the future as a result of technological progress (included in the values corresponding to the parameters of the model chosen to reflect market forces, set below the values that would be adequate for technological progress related to the policy). ii-b) Description of models used The Compact Primes Model (CPM) is a mathematical system implemented in the General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) environment. This is a model for high-level mathematical programming. The energy model is designed to support the development of an energy strategy, including an assessment of policy instruments, energy demand and energy supply planning, and the assessment of climate-change-mitigation policies. The main metric of the model is the energy sector at a detailed level:  energy demand by sector and fuel,  modelling of energy efficiency options,  technology capacities,  a mix of electricity generation, cogeneration and other energy supply technologies,  fuel prices and system costs,  investments by sector and energy-related CO2 emissions. The energy model for Slovakia captures details about energy supply and demand that are critical when designing a low-carbon path. The country-level energy model called Compact-PRIMES for Slovakia (CPS) provides a technology-rich upward analysis for key energy sector elements and was designed to assess low-carbon options for the energy sector. The CPS is a partial country equilibrium model for the energy sector that balances energy supply and demand. As it is a hybrid model with details of technology and engineering along with microeconomic and macroeconomic interactions and dynamics, CPS sectoral decisions consider technologies and costs. On the supply side, it captures the supply of electricity and heat as well as that of biomass. Energy demand modelling assesses the energy needs of industry (and 10 subsectors), households, transport and the services sector. The CPS model proposal is suitable for quantifying long-term energy planning and policies to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions.  ENVISAGE Slovakia - a macroeconomic model for Slovakia that complements the energy model while using the detailed results of the CPS energy model and assessing influences and impacts on the whole economy. It has all the features of a standard general computable equilibrium model with  additional specialisation in energy, electricity generation and emissions, so is useful for assessing climate policies. The macroeconomic model called the ENVISAGE Slovakia Applied General Equilibrium Model (Slovak-CGE) is tailored to reflect the specific characteristics of the Slovak economy. One important feature is that the demand for energy commodities in households and enterprises is sensitive to the price of the commodity, which makes it possible to analyse the various options for electricity generation. Compared to the CPS energy model, the aim of the Slovak-CGE model is to simulate the wider economic effects of moving towards a low-carbon economy. A detailed description of the models is given in the Final Report on the Low-Carbon Study of Slovakia Project, which is available on the website of the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic.  ii-c) Emissions projections in the energy sector (excluding transport)  the energy sector produces greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion and conversion of fossil fuels. It was necessary to focus on methodological improvements due to the complexity of greenhouse gas emission projections in energy and industry. For this reason, the new model for the energy and large industry sector has replaced the originally used MESSAGE model. This approach is in line with the prepared study of low-carbon growth for Slovakia entitled Implementation of the EU Framework for Climate and Energy Policies by 2030 and also with the methodology for the preparation of the National Low-Carbon Strategy of the Slovak Republic.  The modelling of emission projections was performed based on the results of the new CPS model. The CPS model is still not fully calibrated for the CRF categorisation of greenhouse gas emissions to meet reporting obligations, so the model results had to be adjusted according to the GHG inventory. The modelling outputs were determined based on the potential of the greenhouse gas reduction measures. Projections of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector are modelled in the WEM scenario, which includes the following policies and measures at EU level:  Ecodesign Framework Directive (Directive 2005/32/EC);  Directive on the energy labelling of products (Directive 2010/30/EU);  The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the Energy Efficiency Directive (Directive 2012/27/EU);  Completion of the internal energy market, including provisions of the 3rd package (Directive 2009/73/EC, Directive 2009/72/EC), Regulation (EC) 715/2009, Regulation (EC) 714/2009;  Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources - Directive on renewable energy sources - including the ILUC amendment (Directive 2009/28/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2015/1513);  EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC amended by Directive 2004/101/EC (international credits), Directive 2008/101/EC (air transport), Directive 2009/29/EC (revision of the climate and energy package to 2020), Regulation (EU) 176/2014, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 (market stabilisation reserve) and implementing decisions, in particular 2010/384/EU, 2010/634/EU, 2011/389/EU, 2013/448/EU, 2011/278/EU, 2011/638/EU (benchmarking and carbon leakage list);  Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on car emission standards, Regulation (EC) 443/2009, as amended by EU Regulation 333/2014, EURO 5 and 6 Regulations;  Regulation 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the type-approval of motor vehicles;   Regulation 510/2011 setting emission standards for new light commercial vehicles as amended by Regulation 253/2014. In addition to the above-mentioned EU-level policies and the national policies needed to implement the 2020 commitments, the WEM scenario includes the following national specific measures:  Optimisation of district heating systems - transition from fossil fuels to biomass and natural gas;  Gradual decommissioning of solid fuel heating plants from 2025;  Subsidies to promote alternative-fuel vehicles - EUR 5 000 for BEV and EUR 3 000 for PHEV to 2020. The development of greenhouse gas emission projections in the energy sector expressed as CO2 equivalent is shown in Table 39 and Figure 20.

The WEM scenario envisages a decline in mining in 2030, but the actual date for the end of coal mining support in the Slovak Republic has been shifted to 2023. Thus, the total emissions calculated based on the WEM scenario will be lower than shown in Table 39 for 2025-2040.  ii-d) Projections of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction, transport and distribution of natural gas and oil in the Slovak Republic for the 2017-2040 period The input data were obtained from the following sources:  Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic (for 2017);  CPS Model. For the calculation of fugitive emissions (and projections) of methane from the extraction, transport and distribution of natural gas and oil in the Slovak Republic, emission factors from the following sources were used:  IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories - Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions (IPCC 2006 GL);  IPCC Guidelines on best practices and unpredictability management in national greenhouse gas inventories (IPCC 2000 GPG). Projections of fugitive methane emissions from the extraction, transport and distribution of natural gas and oil in the Slovak Republic were estimated based on the following assumptions:  Oil production in the Slovak Republic is anticipated to cease after 2020;  Natural gas production will only decline slowly;  Consumption/distribution of natural gas and oil in Slovakia will remain unchanged;  Redirecting the supply of natural gas through the Nord Stream pipeline will reduce the amount of gas transported to other countries by pipelines in Slovakia, resulting in a reduction in fugitive CH4 emissions.

In addition to projections of fugitive CH4 emissions from the extraction, transport and distribution of natural gas and oil in the Slovak Republic, projections of CO2, NMVOC and N2O emissions were also calculated, but their importance for the overall projections of greenhouse gas emissions in this category is negligible. The calculations used the same methodology and conditions as for methane.

The prediction of energy consumption in the transport sector was determined as the percentage shares of fuels in total consumption in the energy sector. Road transport emissions projections were calculated based on the following data and activities:  Aggregation of data transmitted from the COPERT 5 road transport model for the 2000-2017 period, as the current COPERT version uses a total of 382 road vehicle categories. The aggregation took into account the mode of transport, the fuel used and the EURO emission standard.  Update of data on new registrations and scrapped vehicles from the EVO IS.  Allocation of new vehicle registrations to vehicle categories based on their energy consumption forecasts.  Distribution of scrapped vehicles into categories of older vehicles so that their number gradually decreases to zero through the ongoing renewal of the Slovak Republic vehicle fleet.  The estimated number of vehicles for each year (2018-2040) based on new vehicle registrations and the number of vehicles scrapped.  Aggregation of annual mileage according to COPERT calculations for the 2000-2017 period into defined vehicle categories and the assumption of mileage development for 20182040.  Transfer of implied emission factors from COPERT and their appropriate breakdown for vehicle categorisation in the design model.  Calculation of future transport performance for the 2018-2040 period for the given vehicle categories.  Calculation of emission projections by multiplying performance and emission factors. Greenhouse gas emission projections in category 1.A.3.b - Road transport, in the scenario with measures were prepared according to EU 2016 RS (WEM). CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions projections under the WEM scenario will fall to 2040. This trend is explained by the measures outlined and applied in the scenario (Table 40). Emissions from biomass are not calculated separately in emission projections, but increasing the share of biofuels in petrol and diesel affects CO2 emission factors and, consequently, CO2 projections. The Slovak Republic and other countries are implementing various policies and measures to reduce the environmental burden of the transport sector. All policies and measures described in the previous chapters for the transport sector are in line with the prepared Low-Carbon Study of the Slovak Republic. Of these measures, only those for which emission reduction effects could be calculated in the WEM scenario were evaluated and used.

Non-road emission projections were calculated in a simpler way using AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling. Only a scenario with WEM measures was prepared for these projections.

The scenario with measures is based on the EU 2016 RS (WEM) scenario. The projections of greenhouse gas emissions from the IPPU sector that are not included in the EU ETS have been modelled using the trend in value added in the industry segment and productivity trends. The CO2 emissions projection in category 2.A.2 - Lime production also included CO2 projections in the category Food, beverages and tobacco, mainly due to the use of limestone in the sugar industry. The N2O and CH4 emission projections in categories 2.B.1 - Production of ammonia and hydrogen, and 2.B.2 - Nitric acid production, took the trend in natural gas consumption in the chemical industry category into account, while the nitric acid projections took the productivity trend in the chemical industry, fertilizer production and petrochemistry into account.  The CH4 emissions projections in category 2.C.2 - Ferroalloys and CO2 emissions from category 2.C.5 - Lead production took the development of productivity in the basic processing of non-ferrous metals into account. CO2 emissions projections in category 2.D - Lubricants, paraffins and solvents took the productivity trend in the non-energy use of liquid fuels for projections in the lubricants category into account. The trend in CO2 emissions from paraffin production has been constant over the last 10 years and has also been used in projections. The productivity trend in the textile production category was taken into account in the projections of CO2 emission from solvents.  F-gas emission projections - F-gas emission projections were calculated based on the limits set by Regulation (EU) 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing Regulation (EC) III (Table 46).

The SF6 emission projections in category 2.G under the WEM scenario followed the extrapolation of the base year (taking into account time series consistency) with the assumption of a gradual exclusion of obsolete installations. N2O emission projections in category 2.G were taken into account mainly due to the use of N2O as propellant in aerosol containers.  The development of greenhouse gas emission projections in terms of CO2 equivalent under the scenario with measures (WEM) from the industrial processes sector, including F-gases, is presented in Table 47 and Figure 24.

Real values for 2016 and 2017, Source: SHMI  ii-h) Projections of emissions from agriculture The potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture is related to manure management, in particular to the handling and storage of manure and slurry and to changing animal feed plans. These measures have been incorporated into the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. The current legislation is in line with Good Agricultural Practice and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) at national level. The CAP is divided into two pillars:  direct subsidies per hectare of farmed land and livestock payments,   the Rural Development Programme (RDP), which supports rural development projects, in particular the promotion of resource efficiency, and support for the transition to low-carbon agriculture that is climate-resilient and self-sufficient in food. The Slovak Republic uses RDP funds to modernize storage capacities for manure and slurry, to improve animal living conditions and modernize animal housing facilities. Some measures also have an impact on reducing not only greenhouse gas emissions but also ammonia from the rearing of cattle and pigs. It is essential to minimize nitrogen losses in the form of emissions through effective control of the nitrogen cycle in agriculture. Low-emission techniques for manure and slurry storage are used on large and medium-sized farms characterized by intensive and semi-intensive farming. Small farmers are not currently included in the RDP mechanism due to their limited livestock numbers. The time series of the input data for the preparation of the emission projections were of different length (longest for the 1970-2016 period, shortest for the 2003-2016 period) and were obtained from various sources as follows:  Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic (SO SR) - statistical database, number of livestock. The most important parameter is the number of livestock used to estimate CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and CH4 and N2O emissions from fertilizer management. The results were used in the WEM scenario.  National Agricultural and Food Centre - Research Institute of Agriculture and Food Economics (NAFC - RIAFE). Status and forecast reports analysed the new available legislation and national strategies for the future development of animal rearing. This showed that no legislation or strategies have been taken into account.  National Agricultural and Food Centre - Animal Production Research Institute (NAFC - APRI) - information on animal feeding. Information on animal feeding is important for estimating CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation used in the WEM scenario.  Central Control and Testing Institute in Agriculture (CCTIA) - statistical database of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers, lime utilisation and urea consumption. The consumption of nitrogen fertilizers, lime and urea was taken into account in the WEM scenario. Projections of livestock numbers to 2040 assume a further significant decline in inventory, which is not in accordance with the Concept of Agricultural Development of the Slovak Republic. More details on activities and projected parameters are given in Table 48.

These are adaptive time series forecasting methods, which means that the model parameter values change over time. The forecast is based on balancing weights that give different observations different meanings. The most recent observations have the highest weighting, and this decreases exponentially towards the past. Weighting values are optimized by the statistical software itself. The calculations were based on analyses of the historical time series of individual forecasted indicators, assuming the current state of affairs for other external factors. These may affect the forecasted parameters in different intensities and directions, but their future development is often unpredictable. For example, CAP measures have significant impacts on both animal and plant production. Negotiations on its direction beyond 2020 are still ongoing, and the final version of the reform for the 2021-2028 period will only be known in three years time. In addition to the CAP, a number of other factors  whether economic (supply, demand, prices of agricultural inputs and outputs, etc.), political or accidental (natural disasters, climate change, etc.)  can influence the indicators in question. Although current projections may differ from actual values achieved in the future due to a number of external factors, the forecasts reflect current trends and expectations for the future relatively well. In particular, the continuing decline in livestock production in Slovakia could lead to a gradual decline in the numbers of most livestock (cattle, pigs, poultry, horses and, to some extent, sheep). This may also result in an increase in the consumption of industrial fertilizers, which will have to replace the lack of organic fertilizers in the soil. The emission projections were then calculated using the methodology given in IPCC 2006 GL. The Slovak Republic does not use a specific model to estimate trends in emissions. The calculation of methane is based on the estimation of specific parameters from animal food rations. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management are estimated consistently in the common model due to the common parameters used, in particular the gross intake of energy (Charts 25 and 26). The basis for estimating nitrogen emissions is the analysis of the nitrogen cycle in agriculture. The emission balance took into account national specific parameters as well as an analysis of the nitrogen cycle, which is the basis for the accurate estimation of emissions and projections in agriculture in Slovakia. Emissions projections from the agricultural land category were prepared using the WEM scenario (identical to the WAM scenario). The projections have a rising trend due to the projected increase in urea and limestone consumption. The application of limestone to soil is important  it is used to increase soil fertility. Urea consumption is also anticipated to increase  this is used as an inorganic nitrogen fertilizer, and the increase in inorganic nitrogen fertilizer consumption is related to the lack of organic nitrogen in the soil because of the decline in livestock numbers (Figure 27) and its compensation with inorganic fertilizers.

Table 50 describes the methods suitable for reducing emissions arising from these measures. The Slovak Republic has prepared only one scenario for emission projections in agriculture, and this is the WEM scenario, which is identical to the WAM scenario. This includes measures in manure and slurry management, and policies for reducing emissions from agricultural land, which are included in the CAP and Act of the Government of the Slovak Republic No 488/2010. The following Figures show the results of modelling emissions projections from the agriculture sector.

Projections for greenhouse gas emissions and capture assess all scenarios (without measures, with existing measures and with additional measures) and projection parameters (for managed forests). The baseline projection year was 2016. The projections for greenhouse gas emissions and capture in the LULUCF sector were prepared based on the following input data:  afforestation of unforested areas,    grassing over of arable land,  enhancement of protection from forest fires. Without measures (WOM)  this scenario corresponds to the state of forestry and land use without the measures implemented before 2016, as well as the measures planned for the future. Forest development is estimated according to effective forest management plans without the introduction of specific measures.  With Existing Measures (WEM)  this scenario includes the impacts of the measures under consideration and implemented before 2016. From 2004 to 2006, only minimal specific mitigation measures were implemented in the LULUCF sector. During this period, afforestation of agricultural land was supported by the Rural Development Programme (RDP) and the Sectoral Operational Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development. The conversion of agricultural land into forest land (afforestation) has been approved under these programmes for 15 projects covering a total of 100 hectares. Between 2007 and 2016, afforestation of unforested areas and grassing over of arable land continued under the Regional Development Programmes for 2007-2013 and 2014-2020. The following mitigation measures were considered in the WEM scenario:  afforestation of 800 ha of less productive land with rapidly growing tree species and the first afforestation of 600 ha of agricultural land by 2016;  grassing over of 50 000 ha of arable land by 2016;  the impact of Regulation No 2152/2003/EC on forest monitoring and environmental interactions in society; this legislation also focuses on forest fires and estimates the reduction in forest fire risk to 90% as compared to the 2000-2003 period. Figure 28 Projections of CO2 emissions and capture (in Gg) in category 4.A.1 - Forest land remaining forest land, WOM and WEM scenarios   Figure 29 Projections of CO2 emissions and capture (in Gg) in category 4.A.2 - Land converted to forest (afforestation), WOM and WEM scenarios    Table 51 presents the results from the modelling of projections of CO2 emissions and capture from the LULUCF sector. The WOM and WEM scenarios are almost identical because measures to reduce emissions or increase capture had no significant impact on CO2 trends in the LULUCF sector. As can be seen in Table 51, CO2 capture is in the range of 4 600 to 9 000 Gg CO2. The projections for CO2 capture in the 2030-2037 period show a falling trend, the main factor of which is a decrease in biomass increments in managed forests as a result of a decrease in the relative age of forests with the highest wood biomass increment. Model results indicate this trend is anticipated to change after 2037.

The area of forest land reached 2.019 million ha, of which stands covered 1.946 million ha. Since 1990, the area of forest land has increased by 42 700 ha and stands by 24 600 ha. The timber stock on forest land increased from 348.5 to 480.3 million m3 raw wood without bark. The area of forest stands on non-forest land increased from 273 000 to 288 000 ha and timber stocks from 38 to 46 million m3. The total forested area of the Slovak Republic, calculated from stands, is 45.1%. At  present, due to the current age composition, wood reserves are at the highest they have been for at least the last century. The same statement applies to non-forest land. Dead wood is an important component of forest ecosystems to promote biodiversity, and should be kept in forests to an extent appropriate to its functional focus. There is currently 87.0 million m3 of dead wood on forest land and 6.8 million m3 in stands on non-forest land. Converted per hectare, these figures are significantly higher than the European average. This situation is mainly due to the deteriorated condition of forests after a wide range of calamities and insufficient stand hygiene. The decomposition of dead wood is also a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The state of forest stands has an impact on the balance of greenhouse gas emissions and capture. The significant scope of calamities and the rapid aging of the remaining stands have reduced the capture possibilities after 1990 from approx. 8 500 Gg to the current 4 500 to 5 500 Gg per year. The most important carbon storage in forest stands is living biomass, the amount of which depends on the maintenance of or increase in the production capacity of the forests. With regard to the impact of climate change, it is also necessary to improve the age structure of the forests by gradually decreasing the area of older stands with decreasing production capacity.

These two main sources of emissions account for over 80% of the estimated emissions in the waste sector. Emissions from composting, waste incineration, industrial waste disposal and industrial waste water treatment are dynamically estimated from an average of 10 years (2007-2017), while the constant value of 2017 is used throughout the projected 2018-2040 period only in the case of municipal waste composting. Emissions from municipal waste disposal are affected by the amount of waste disposed of, which is regulated through the Waste Management Act; and landfill gas combustion, which is regulated by  the Air Pollution Control Act. The projections of emissions from municipal waste disposal are therefore divided into waste quantity modelling and landfill gas recovery modelling. Projections of total municipal waste produced are based on projections of waste per capita and population growth. This procedure is in line with the Eunomia prediction43 prepared in 2016. This waste generation prediction is used for all prepared scenarios. The amounts of separated recyclable materials (paper, plastics, glass, food waste, garden waste) are used as variables in the preparation of each scenario. After estimating gross landfill emissions, net emissions are estimated by subtracting the captured CH4. Municipal Waste Management (WEM scenario)  this is based on the expectation that trends in municipal waste management will continue as they have over the last decade. This development is characterized by the organisation of waste collection at municipal level and by increased separation of recyclable materials, with landfilling still the main waste disposal method. It is anticipated that ir current output (200 kt/year). Landfill gas is obtained only for profit from electricity generation, and electricity suppliers are reluctant to connect these new energy producers. The increase in methane recovery from landfill gas follows trends from the previous decade. The main document defining the waste management strategy is the Waste Management Programme of the Slovak Republic 2016-2020. This document notes that the previous waste management plan (2011-2015) did not achieve its targets and notes that the 2013 target of reducing the disposal of biodegradable waste to 50% of the 1995 level has not been achieved  nor was the target of recycling 35% of municipal waste by 2015. The 2021-2025 roadmap is not yet available. The main source of emissions from waste water treatment are retention tanks (septic tanks). CH4 emissions projections from wastewater are based on the changing number of people using public sewerage systems and domestic wastewater treatment plants, with the aim of estimating reductions through tank counts. Nitrogen oxide emissions are based on estimates of protein consumption, while the characterisation of installations as WWTP is assessed as before. Biogas recovery from anaerobic sludge digestion is not a factor affecting emissions, since wastewater legislation requires that all anaerobic treatment plants have combustion or biogas combustion systems. In addition, heat produced from biogas is an important element of the energy balance of wastewater treatment plants under the Slovak climate. Waste water sector (WEM scenario) - Only one scenario has been prepared for the waste water sector. There are no quantified targets available to define alternative scenarios for the 2018-2040 period. The scenario with measures is based on the expectation that developments in waste management will continue as observed in the last decade. These can be characterized as the gradual development of sewage systems and the modernisation of wastewater treatment plants to meet the requirements of EU water sector strategies. The scenario assumes that the number of retention tanks will decrease as a result of the expansion of sewerage systems from the current 68% to 75% and the number of domestic waste water treatment plants from the original 2% to 5%.                                                  43 https://www.eunomia.co.uk/    The model for modelling the amount of waste is derived from statistical data on municipal waste published by the Statistical Office of the SR44 and an analysis of waste composition published by 45. The total amount of waste is estimated based on demographic forecasts and the percentage of waste per inhabitant. The waste produced is divided into mixed municipal waste, a group of separately collected fractions (separated waste) subject to waste composition analysis, and a group of other separately collected fractions not covered by waste composition analysis. The same division applies to landfilled waste. Total landfilled waste is estimated as the difference between the total waste produced and the sum of recovered and incinerated waste. The model uses a number of separated fractions as input variables. These variables are used to estimate the amount of mixed/residual waste as well as changes in the composition of the waste. An overview of the model parameters and their interdependencies is given in the following table.
