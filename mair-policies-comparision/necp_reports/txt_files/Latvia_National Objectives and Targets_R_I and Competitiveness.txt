3.5. Research, innovation and competitiveness  SDSL2030 includes a vision of innovation and a transition to the creation of low-carbon goods and services with high energy intensity, the use of RES and development of technologies, and  identifies the need to develop cooperation of research institutions and companies in the field of RES, however, no specific goals, action lines or support measures are defined for the development of P&I and technologies in specific priority areas.  3.5.1. Research and development and innovation In the period from 2021 to 2027, there are plans for a targeted support for the development and implementation of R&I climate technologies, in particular within the scope of implementation of the Smart Specialisation Strategy (Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation  RIS3) and NIPG2020 thematic strategic ecosystems155. One of the most significant preconditions for the development and implementation of new technologies and innovative products and services are investments in R&D. The indicative target indicator of NDP2027 for investments in R&D is planned at the level of 2 % of GDP in 2027, which is provisionally projected also as a target indicator for 2030.  In the 2021-2027 programming period it is necessary to invest at least 25 % of total investments in R&D in the development and implementation of climate technologies, and for the achievement of climate targets, in particular supporting R&D activities for increasing energy efficiency, the transition to RE, measures related to adaptation to climate change and prevention of climate                                                       154 a protected user is a poor or low-income family (person), a large family or a family (person) that takes care of a child with disability, or a person with group I disability who uses electricity in his or her household for his or her own needs (for final consumption) 155 Strategic ecosystems will be shaped as basic elements of the national research and innovation system, which will be developed by creating a targeted link between education, research and business activities and creating a proper financial system and regulation. 91  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 related risks, as well as measures in the field of water management, agriculture, forestry and waste management.156 Table 21s for the research and development policy and their performance indicators Policy outcome in the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension Actual value Target value 2017 2020 2030157 Turnover of innovative products (% of total turnover) 46.5158 - >14 Share of enterprises active in innovation (% of all enterprises) 30.5159 - >40 Share of high technology sector exports (% of total annual exports) 10.2 - >15 Global Competitiveness Index (position in the world) 42 - <40 Investment in R&D (% of GDP) 0.51 0.7 > 2 Investments in R&I for the achievement of energy and climate objectives (% of total investments in R&I) - - at least 25 Public funding160 investments in R&I for the achievement of energy and climate objectives (% of total investments in R&I) 19 - at least 25 Requested public foreign funding in R&I in the field of climate, energy and transport (% of total funding raised by LV) 24161 25% 25% One of the main challenges of Latvia in the new 2021-2027 programming period is increasing productivity, which is closely related to production optimisation, technological upgrades and greater investment in R&D and R&I. The plan defines potential priority action lines in RIS3 for energy:  Innovative solutions in the field of RES technologies, incl. for production and use of biomethane, hydrogen and modern biofuels, smart use of biomass before combustion, use of solar energy in transport.  Innovative solutions for energy storage, integration and smart transmission.  Innovative solutions in the field of energy efficiency and sustainability of buildings, including development of heat insulation materials and technologies, creation of materials with high resource efficiency and energy efficiency and development of production technologies. 3.5.2. Promoting clean energy technologies for 2050  No specific R&I objectives or target indicators have been set in existing policies for the development of clean technologies and innovation focusing on improvement of energy efficiency and decarbonisation. Four out of  6 SET-Plan priorities in which R&I should be developed are of particular relevance to Latvia.                                                        156 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/communication-euco-mff-oct2019_en.pdf 157 Regular font is used for already applicable targets, which are set out in binding EU legislation, other Latvian policy planning documents or legislation, bold font is used for the binding targets to be defined in the Plan 158 Volume in 2016 (https://data1.csb.gov.lv/pxweb/lv/uzn/uzn__inovac/ING021.px/table/tableViewLayout1/) 159 In the period from 2014 to 2016 (https://data1.csb.gov.lv/pxweb/lv/uzn/uzn__inovac/ING051.px/table/tableViewLayout1/) 160 Funding from the EU structural funds and national budget 161 Data about the period from 2014 to 2019 (Horizon 2020) 92  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Table 22-Plan priorities (share of investment in total R&I investments in the field of energy) SET-Plan priorities162 Actual value Target value In the period from 2014 to 2018 In the period from 2021 to 2027 RE 10% 15% Smart energy systems 26% 20% Energy efficient systems (residential buildings and industry) 28% 38% Sustainable transport 15% 20% Carbon capture and storage 0% 2% Safe nuclear energy 0% 0% Energy management and market 20% 5%                                                       162  in green
