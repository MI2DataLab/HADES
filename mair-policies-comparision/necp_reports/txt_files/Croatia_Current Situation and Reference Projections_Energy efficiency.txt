Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling  Indicators of potential for use of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling for the period 2016-of Economy (today under the Ministry of Environment and Energy) in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 1 Directive 2012/27/EC. The established overall (theoretical) potential for high-efficiency cogeneration plants in the Republic of Croatia is observed through two scenarios of shares of future consumers of DHS coupled with high-efficiency cogeneration: conservative and optimistic. Scenarios are based on the share of consumers of district heating systems that are assumed based on the determined existing trends (conservative scenario), or optimistic assumptions of positive changes in the economy of the Republic of Croatia (optimistic scenario). Indicators of potential for use of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling is presented in Table 413.

Projections taking into account existing policies, measures and energy efficiency programmes, as described in 1.2. (ii), for primary and final energy consumption by sector by 2040 at least (including projections for 2030)  Projections of primary and final energy consumption in the period from 2020 to 2040, taking into account only existing policies, measures and energy efficiency programmes are presented in Figure 4-15.   Figure 4-15. Projection of energy consumption by 2040 with existing policies, measures and energy efficiency programmes  iv. Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU Minimum energy performance requirements of buildings are determined by cost-optimal method in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings in 2013 and 2014, for residential buildings (single-family and multi-dwelling) and non-residential buildings (offices, educational buildings, wholesale and retail trade buildings, 192  hospitals, hotels, restaurants and halls)17. The energy performance is determined through maximum permissible primary energy for buildings, using a number of additional parameters that define more precisely the behaviour of a building (required energy, thermal transmittance of the external envelope, share of RES, performance level of the technical building systems and others). During 2018, a new cycle of cost optimization of minimum requirements for the energy performance of buildings was initiated by using dynamic calculation methods of the energy performance of buildings and by comparing values with the national algorithm for calculating the energy performance of buildings in order to align requirements with market changes and new available technologies and in order to elaborate the calculation method and determine the energy performance of buildings. The results of this cycle should be available and implemented in the regulation by the end of 2019, including the determination of gap in relation to current requirements and measures to bridge that gap
