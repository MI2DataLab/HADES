  46   2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 2.1 Decarbonisation Dimension 2.1.1 GHG emissions and removals i. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4 According to the climate and energy policy framework for the period until 2030 the Union has committed to a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % by 2030 as compared to 1990. All sectors must contribute to achieving a reduction in emissions. The target will be achieved collectively by the EU, with a 43 % and 30 % reduction to be achieved by, respectively, the ETS and non-ETS sectors by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) is at the heart of the EU strategy for reducing GHG emissions from the industry and energy sectors. Regulation (EU) 2018/842 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 sets out the national targets for non-ETS sectors (building stock, agriculture, waste management and transport). The national target for GHG emission reduction in these sectors by 2030 compared to 2005 is 0 %. Regulation (EU) 2018/841 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU is part of the  % by 2030 compared to 1990. The Regulation requires that Member States balance emissions and removals in the land use sector for two five-year periods between 2021 and 2030 (2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030) by applying certain accounting rules and allowing for certain flexibility. In order to counter climate change and mitigate its impact on the economy, Bulgaria has drawn up a National Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change and an Action Plan thereto, which was adopted by a Decision of the Council of Ministers in 2019. The document defines the strategic framework and priorities for climate change enhance its capacity to adapt its environmental, social and economic systems to climate change impacts. The National strategy on adaptation to climate change covers the following nine sectors: Agriculture, Forests, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Water, Energy, Transport, Urban Environment, Human Health and Tourism. It includes an analysis of the macroeconomic effects of climate change and an assessment of the sector tasked with the management of disaster risks.   47  approach to be taken to adapting key sectors of the economy to climate change.  An Action Plan to the Strategy has also been developed, which sets out the goals and priorities for improving adaptation capacity. The plan contains a detailed description of the financial resources, expected results and competent institutions for the implementation of policy measures implementation for each sector. The scope and scenarios for sector adaptation reflect the scope and complexity of the effects of climate change. The measures primarily aim to strengthen policy response and ensure that climate change adaptation is included in the legal framework; build adaptation capacity and develop financial, social and political guidelines on risk management; and improve knowledge management, research, education and communication with stakeholders. Projected emissions of GHG gases from the Energy sector with additional measures (WAM) is based on modelling, using the (B)EST model for long-term power generation assessment and planning. The projections take into account both existing measures to reduce GHG emissions and a number of additional measures set out in detail in sections Energy from renewable sources, Energy efficiency, Energy security and Internal energy market, which contribute to a significant chgreenhouse gas emissions. As at 2015, more than 74 % of GHG emissions were generated by the energy sector. Its transformation is therefore key to reducing GHG emissions overall. The measures leading to higher energy efficiency in power generation, the industry and the households sector, increase the share of energy from renewable sources in power generation and transport, and the planned changes to be undertaken on the internal energy market have a significant contribution to lowering GHG emissions. The implementation of additional measures will result in several trends that apply to the entire energy sector. These are set out in the table below: Table 2: Projected GHG emissions from the energy sector with additional measures, in Gg CO2 eq.  ktoe  WAM scenario Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 2 emissions, ktoe CO2 45 428.60 43 579.24 42 088.03 35 702.85 CH4 and N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 1 822.85 2 084.99 2 036.75 1 889.17 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2eq. 47 251.45 45 664.23 44 124.78 37 592.02 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling   48  Projections take into account all existing measures for GHG emissions reduction. Bulgaria has taken substantial measures to restructure its energy system  existing measures are reinforced by additional measures aiming to promote the use of energy from renewable sources in order to achieve an overall target of approximately 27 % of energy from renewable sources in final energy consumption. In addition, the implementation of the policy measures on energy efficiency is expected to lower energy consumption in all sectors thereby contributing to a further reduction in GHG emissions. The results of the modelling show that GHG emission levels in the energy sector will decrease by approximately 19 % until 2030 as compared to 2015 (baseline). This is attributable to the significant drop in primary energy generation from nuclear fuel, the use of natural gas and an increase in the use of energy from renewable sources (such as solar energy, wind power and biomass) in combination with the improved energy efficiency of residential building stock and in the industrial and energy sectors. Figure 1: Primary energy producers (GWh)  Solid fuels Natural gas Hydropower Wind power Geothermal power Oil and petroleum products Nuclear energy Biomass and waste Solar and other types of energy  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling In the WAM scenario, the final consumption of energy from solid fuels is projected to decrease by 2030. An increase in the consumption of energy from renewable sources has been projected. During the period, the final consumption of heat from gaseous fuels, steam and renewable sources will remain at the same level. No major peaks and slumps in trends are expected. The changes expected in the consumption of various types of fuels will be higher than WEM scenario projections, which are based on continued implementation of existing measures, due to the additional measures envisaged for EE and RES.   49   Figure 2: Final energy consumption by type of fuel and energy (GWh)   Solid fuels Natural gas Heat Oil and petroleum products Electricity Renewable energy sources Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling As regards energy consumption in the different sectors, no significant changes in terms of the share of each sector in final demand for electricity is expected as shown below: Figure 3: Final energy consumption by sector (GWh)  Industry Services Households Transport (3) Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling   Energy industries The projections under this scenario also indicate that the energy industries will continue to generate the bulk of emissions. The projected trends for emissions in the Energy industries subsector are set out in the table below.   50  Table 3: Emission projections for the Energy subsector with additional measures, in CO2 eq.  ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 CO2 emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 29 376.24 27 572.58 26 386.36 20 978.51 N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq.  117.30 96.93 94.37 71.88 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2eq. 29 493.54 27 669.51 26 480.73 21 050.39 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling The final energy consumption of different industry sectors In the period until 2030 will remain at relatively stable levels, with an expected significant decrease in the use of solid fuels, including diesel, for power generation in the processing industry and the construction sector, along with a parallel increase in auto-production from renewable sources. Under this scenario the total quantity of GHG emissions generated by the energy industries by 2030 are expected to decrease by approximately 26 % as compared to GHG emissions in 2015 (baseline). This is equal to approximately 102 % of the projected emissions reduction under the WEM scenario. Manufacturing industry and construction The projections for this sector are based on the expectations and forecasts for economic development, the shares of individual subsectors, the projected use of fuels, as well as on general projections for the use of some primary energy sources.

This would be the outcome of the continued implementation of existing policy measures along with the introduction of a number of additional measures set out in detail in section Energy Efficiency as shown by the overall decrease in the energy intensity of industrial sectors and the efforts to promote the use of renewable energy in industry. The implementation of these measures will contribute to the achievement of the national greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Energy consumption by the different sectors in the period until 2030 will remain relatively stable, with no major peaks or slumps expected in individual branches of the manufacturing industry. The scenario at hand once again projects a significant drop in the use of solid and liquid fuels in power generation in the industry subsector  approximately 1.1 times higher than the drop expected under the WEM scenario.   51  Figure 4: Final consumption of energy by sector (GWh)  Iron and steel Construction materials Machine building Ferrous metals Paper and pulp Textile Chemistry Food, beverages and tobacco Other industries Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Figure 5: Final energy consumption by type of fuel and energy in the Processing industry and Construction sectors (GWh)  Solid fuels Gas Solar Hydrogen Electricity Liquid fuels Biomass Geothermal Heat   Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Transport The projection for the development of the Transport subsector is based on the projected use of fuels in the sector. The transport sector is divided into four subsectors: road traffic, air traffic, rail traffic and navigation.  Table 5: Emission projections in the Transport subsector with additional measures, CO2 eq.  ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030   52  CO2 emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 8 903.71 8 982.78 9 168.53 8 882.54 CH4 and N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 110.32 113.56 113.90 107.23 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 9 014.03 9 096.34 9 282.43 8 989.77 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  With regard to GHG emissions from the Transport subsector, projections under the WAM scenario indicate that a small and more gradual reduction in emissions may be expected by 2030 as compared to 2015 (baseline used for modelling purposes). The overall increase in energy consumption in transport is attributable to the aviation segment, which is expected to grow by approximately 35 % as compared to 2020. In the period between 2020 and 2030 private road transport is also expected to grow by 7 %, with a small increase also expected in the rail transport segment. As regards renewable energy used in transport, diversification of sources has been projected on account of the introduction of new generation biofuels (1 095 GWh in 2030) and hydrogen 32 GWh by 2030). These changes in the energy resources used in transport, including the projected increase in the share of electric public transport and hybrid electrical vehicles, coupled with the development of charging stations infrastructure in urban areas, are projected to result in a reduction in registered GHG emissions.

Here, as in public transport, GHG emissions from the road transport segment are expected to remain stable throughout the period, with an increase of the share of aviation and rail transport. In addition, a small decrease in private road transport has been projected, with the implementation of additional measures contributing to GHG emission levels remaining lower as compared to the WEM scenario. A gradual increase in the volume of road haulage services as compared to that in the rail transport and inland waterway transport is expected.  The additional measures envisaged for the transport sector concern primarily the higher share of biofuels in conventional fuel blends and the higher number of electric vehicles (particularly light-duty vehicles).

GHG emissions are projected to increase by approximately 30 %, which is consistent with the increase projected under the WEM scenario. No additional measures have been planned.  Projected GHG emissions in the Agriculture sector The GHG emission projections for the Agriculture sector are set out in the table below.     55  Table 7: Emission projections for the Agriculture sector with additional measures, ktoe CO2 eq. Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 CH4 emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 1 633.94 1 889.72 1 950.00 2 036.54 N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 4 409.58 4 465.18 4 872.92 5 280.78 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 6 043.52 6 354.90 6 822.92 7 317.32 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling The data set out in the table above shows that no additional measures to reduce the emissions generated by the Agriculture sector have been planned. An increase in registered GHG emissions by approximately 20 %, as in the WEM scenario, has been projected as a result of the expected growth of the sector  an estimation based on projections provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forests. The measures taken into account in the modelling exercise underlying the Third National Climate Change Action Plan and the National Air Pollution Control Programme for the period 20202030 have been validated for the WAM scenario. Projected GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector  The main category contributing to GHG emissions removals is the forestry sector. All other 2 emissions. The main reason for the flat overall results for removals is the decrease in removals by the forestry sector and a small increase in GHG emissions from cropland, settlements and wetland. The main reason for the decrease in GHG emission removals by forests is the lower growth rate of forests attributable to their average age. The increase in the use of biomass is not expected to have a negative impact on land use and the LULUCF sector overall on account of the significant potential for the use of forestry products and forestry residues. The additional requirements for land stem from the use of biofuels: the transition from conventional fuel production to the production of new generation biofuels will have a positive effect on land use because the latter category of biofuels require less land for crop cultivation as compared to the land needed for the cultivation of crops for conventional fuels. In order to ensure that sufficient biomass is available, Bulgaria will rely on forest biomass in accordance with the National Action Plan for Energy from Forest Biomass for the period 2018-2027 but also on the unutilised potential of the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from biological origin from agriculture, including vegetal and animal matter from forestry and related industries, including fisheries and aquaculture, and the biodegradable fraction of waste, including industrial and municipal waste of biological origin, that satisfy the sustainability criteria stipulated in Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II Directive).  In the period between 2020 and 2030, the land necessary for the cultivation of crops to sustain the production of conventional fuels will decrease. The additional land necessary for the cultivation of new generation fuels, on account of the introduction of new measures to promote the use of new generation biofuels from 2020 onward, will be compensated by the overall reduction in the areas necessary for the cultivation of crops for conventional fuels. Overall, no significant changes in land use are projected to occur in the next 10 years. The model also takes into account the requirements laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/807 of 13 March 2019 as regards LULUCF in relation to the sustainability criteria for biofuels and biomass. As solid biomass is expected to be mostly derived from residues in line with applicable requirements, no additional land for bioenergy generation from biomass will be   56  necessary on account of the projected transition from conventional fuels to new generation biofuels.  WAM scenario projections, similarly to those under the WEM scenario, indicate that Bulgaria will be able to fulfill its obligation not to lower removals below the reference level in the period by 2030. No significant changes in land use and in the removals potential of LULUCF are expected.

Despite this, model projects and data from the National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory shows that a drop in the removals capacity of Bulgarian forests may be expected due to the decrease of the relative share of artificial afforestation and the higher average age of the forests described in point 4.2.1 of the WEM scenario.   Projected GHG emissions in the Waste sector The projected GHG emissions in the Waste sector under the WEM scenario are set out in the table below. The policy measures for the sector set out in the Third National Climate Change Action Plan 20132020 will continue to be implemented and will be further developed. GHG emissions in the sector are projected to decrease by a little over 26 % by 2030 and their levels under the WAM scenario, which takes into account only existing measures, will remain the same. The additional measures planned will accelerate GHG emissions reduction until 2025 but will not have a significant impact on [overall] GHG emissions reduction. This is partly due to the implementation of the National Waste Management Plan, which sets out specific measures for the reduction of waste going to landfill and for intensive waste separation, recycling and recovery according to the waste hierarchy. Better waste management and the collection and recovery of biodegradable waste is essential for both scenarios, and more specifically for the WAM scenario.    57  Table 9: Emission projections in the Waste sector as a result of the implementation of additional measures (WAM scenario), CO2 eq., ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 Total emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 4 157.64 3 759.01 3 410.54 3 062.84 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Conclusion The table below sets out the projections for GHG emissions reduction in Bulgaria as at 2030 with additional measures.

Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable to the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and climate change adaptation goals, if available Not applicable 2.1.2 Renewable energy i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 Bulgaria will strive to achieve a share of at least 27.09 % of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption by 2030. Thus, the national target set should be achieved through an increase in the consumption of energy from renewable sources in all three sectors: electric power, energy for heating and cooling, and transport.   58  between 2020 and 2050 reflects the priority attached to energy efficiency in the transition of the national economy to a low-carbon economy and the share of energy from renewable sources for the reduction of GHG emissions. from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption will be 11.09 percentage points higher than the national target for 2020 set in Annex I to Directive 2009/28/EC5. overachievement in 2020), which has translated into overachievement of the binding national target of 16 % of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption and exceeds the reference values for increase of the shares of energy from renewable sources to be achieved by 2022, 2025 and 2027 set out in Article 4(1)(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.  Bulgaria determined its national target for 2030, taking into account the European target for the share of energy from renewable sources to at least 27 %. It will thus contribute to the highest extent possible to the accelerated increase in the consumption of energy from renewable sources and the achievement of a share of at least 32 % of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption in the European Union by 2030.  Figure 10: Indicative trajectory for the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in Bulgaria for the period 20202030  Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption Share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption determined in accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis                                            5Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources   59  Although Bulgaria has suitable weather conditions for the development of renewable energy, there are some objective restrictions in specific areas where no renewable energy facilities may be constructed. The areas along the boundaries of protected sites within the Natura 2000 network (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora and Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds) are a case in point. According to the NPDEVI 20112020 the construction of wind farms in these areas is prohibited.  With a view to fulfilling its commitments, Bulgaria has designated 234 Sites of Community Importance for the conservation of the natural habitats of wild flora and fauna and 120 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the conservation of wild birds. Protected areas cover 41 053.2 km2 an area of 38 231.84 m2 and sites with an area of 2 821.35 km2 territory. More than 90 habitat types and 121 bird species, including 28 priority habitats and 8 priority species, along with 120 birds and 70 migratory birds, are subject to conservation within the boundaries of the Natura 2000 network. The country holds one of the first places in Europe in terms of this indicator.  The development of energy from renewable sources during the period covered by the INECP will comply with all applicable requirements laid down in environmental legislation, including those applicable to protected areas and the Natura 2000 network.  All projects for the construction of power plants generating energy from renewable sources will be implemented in full compliance with the requirements laid down in the Environmental Protection Act, the Biodiversity Act and other legislative acts in the area of environmental protection.  ii. Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in the period 20212030 in the sectors of electricity, energy for heating and cooling, and transport Bulgaria will achieve the national target for the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2030 (27.09 %) by achieving the following sectoral targets:  30.33 % share of energy from renewable sources in electricity;  42.60 % share of energy from renewable sources in the sector of energy for heating and cooling;  14.2 % share of energy from renewable sources in transport. During the period 20202030 the consumption of energy in the electricity sector is projected to increase owing to an increase in the power generated by solar plants, wind farms and biomass. According to the projections the share of electric power from renewable sources in the electricity sector will increase by 0.55 to 1.24 percentage points per year.    60  Table 11: Indicative trajectory of the share of electric power from renewable sources in gross final electricity consumption for the period 20202030 in the electricity sector  2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Share of electric power from renewable sources in gross final consumption of electricity, % 21.40 21.99 22.56 23.13 23.69 24.24 25.48 26.70 27.92 29.13 30.33 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte The targets in sector Energy for heating and cooling have been set by taking into account the requirements laid down in Article 23(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Directive (EU) No 2018/2001). The cited provision envisages an increase in the share of renewable energy for heating and cooling by an indicative 1.3 percentage points [as an annual average]. That increase may be limited to an indicative 1.1 percentage points for Member States where waste heat and cold is not used. Taking the above requirements into account, an indicative increase by 1.15 percentage points (calculated as the difference between the share of energy from renewable sources between 2020 and 2030 divided by the number of years) has been projected for the period 20202030.  Table 12: Indicative trajectory for the share of renewable energy for heating and cooling in gross final consumption of electricity for heating and cooling for the period 2020-2030  sector energy for heating and cooling  2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Share of renewable energy for heating and cooling in gross final heat consumption, % 31.07 32.48 33.89 35.30 36.71 38.11 38.99 39.88 40.78 41.68 42.60 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte  Article 23(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 introduces a requirement for fuel suppliers to ensure that the share of renewable energy in final consumption of energy in the transport sector is at least 14 % by 2030. In order to achieve the target in the transport sector, the following requirements of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 should be taken into account:  limiting the use of conventional fuels in the road and rail transport to 7 % of final consumption of energy in the sector by 2030;   increasing the share of new generation biofuels in final energy consumption in transport to at least 0.2 % in 2022, at least 1 % in 2025 and at least 3.5 % in 2030;   61   limiting the use of biofuels and biogas produced from the feedstock listed in Part B of Annex IX of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (waste edible oils and animal fat) to a maximum of 1.7 % of the energy content of transport fuels supplied for consumption or use on the market;   the share of renewable electricity is considered to be four times its energy content when supplied to road vehicles and may be considered to be 1.5 times its energy content when supplied to rail transport;  with the exception of fuels produced from food and feed crops, the share of fuels supplied in the aviation and maritime sectors is considered to be 1.2 times their energy content. The projected increase in the use of energy from renewable sources has been calculated by taking the above requirements into account, including the requirement for the biofuels used in transport to satisfy applicable sustainability criteria.  During the period 2020-2030 the share of energy from renewable sources in transport is expected to increase to 14.20 %.

Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy between 2020 and 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology in MW Electricity sector During the period 2020-2030 the net installed capacity of power plants generating electricity from renewable sources is expected to increase by 2 645 MW. This increase will be accompanied by a parallel increase of the net installed capacity of photovoltaic plants (PhVP) by 2 174 MW and wind farms (WF) by 249 MW. The projected increase of the capacity of these plants is lined to accelerated technology development and lowering investment costs for their construction.   62  An increase by 222 MW has also been projected for power plants generating electricity from biomass. For the purpose of accounting their contribution to the achievement of the national target and sectoral targets, it is essential for the gaseous fuels and solid fuels from biomass used by plants generating electricity and energy for heating and cooling with a nominal rated thermal input equal to or higher than 20 MW for solid fuels from biomass and total nominal rated thermal input equal to or higher than 2 MW for gaseous fuels and biomass to satisfy sustainability criteria and lead to a reduction in the GHG emissions referred to in Article 28(2) to (7) and (10) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.

An increase by 46 % in electricity generated by power plants using biomass by 2030 has also been projected. In this segment, the use of biodegradable waste will increase from 14 GWh in 2020 up to 115 GWh in 2030.  The two scenarios considered in the INECP (WAM and WEM) take into account the vulnerability of water resources and the risk of their decrease due to climate change. In keeping with this trend, in the period 20152020 hydroelectricity generation registers a decrease by 17 % (from 5 660 GWh in 2015 to 4 707 GWh in 2020). The electricity output of hydropower plants is expected to remain at the same level throughout the period.

These are expected to have a positive impact on losses from district heating, which are projected to decrease from 2 229 GWh in 2020 to 1 574 GWh in 2030. Regarding the renewable energy mix, there are plans to further develop solar plants, which are expected to generate 347 GWh in energy for heating in 2030.  A significant increase in biomass used for the generation of energy for heating is expected as a result of the development of cogeneration plants (from 4 GWh in 2020 to 2 497 GWh in 2030). At the same time, the share of geothermal sources and heat pumps is expected to register a small increase over the period. The planned increase in biomass consumption includes the use of biodegradable waste, which will also increase over the period 20202030 from 36 ktoe (414 GWh) to 75 ktoe (873 GWh).
