52  2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 2.1 Dimension decarbonisation 2.1.1  GHG emissions and removals i. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4 The European Union ratified the Paris Agreement and committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 emissions. Croatia ratified the Paris Agreement in May 2017 and shares the common EU goal. This common EU objective is divided into two units, of which the first includes large sources of greenhouse gas emissions that are obligated parties of the European Emissions Trading System (ETS sector), and the second for non-ETS sectors, including other relatively smaller emission sources, such as: road and off-road transport (excluding air transport included in the ETS sector), small energy and industrial facilities not included in the ETS sector, households, services, agriculture, waste management, changes in land use and forestry. The Republic of Croatia has set the following targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030:  in the ETS sector: at least 43% compared to the 2005 level7,  for non-ETS sectors: at least 7% compared to the 2005 level. The reduction in emissions for the ETS sector is at least 43% by 2030 compared to 2005, with an annual reduction of the total EU quota of 2.2% for the period from 2021 to 2030 as defined by Directive (EU) 2018/410 (the target for Croatia is indicative, and binding on the level of the EU ETS). For the non-ETS sectors, a common target of at least 30% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 (Regulation (EU) 2018/842) has been set, and the commitments ranged from -40 to 0% for different EU Member States (-7% for Croatia). In accordance with Article 8, paragraph 3 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, the Republic of Croatia, like all other Member States of the European Union, had an obligation to develop a National Forestry Accounting Plan (NFAP) for the period from 2021 to 2025, which was submitted to the European Commission on 31st December 2018. The mentioned plan also proposes the Forest Reference Level (FRL) for the Republic of Croatia. An NFAP review is currently underway and is carried out by a group of experts for the sector of Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Expert Group, LULUCFEG), which were appointed by Member States and which  7 The target for Croatia is indicative, and binding on the level of the EU ETS 53  includes an expert from the Republic of Croatia. The domain of greenhouse gas removal from the forestry sector will be addressed subsequently. In addition, Croatia joins the EU in its efforts to contribute to other international goals, in particular the UN Sustainable Development Agenda, which defines 17 Sustainable Development Goals8 and the new Urban Agenda for the EU9. ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available  National targets for climate change adaptation  Adaptation measures that contribute to the decarbonisation dimension are elaborated in the Draft of the Strategy on Climate Change Adaptation in the Republic of Croatia for the period until 2040 with an outlook to 2070 with an action Plan [4]. The Draft of the Strategy has undergone consultations with the competent bodies and institutions and with the interested public and will be submitted to the Croatian Parliament for adoption. The vision of the Draft of the Adaptation Strategy is "Republic of Croatia resilient to climate change", on the basis of which the following goals have been set:  to reduce the vulnerability of natural systems and society to the negative impacts of climate change,   to increase the ability to recover from the effects of climate change,  to exploit the potential positive effects that may also be due to climate change. Increasing the resilience of vulnerable systems and reducing damage from natural disasters will also contribute to the long-term sustainable development of the Republic of Croatia.  When it comes to the environmental and climate ambition of the Common Agricultural Policy, it is important to highlight the contribution already made by the agricultural sector and the positive solutions implemented at the national and EU level, such as the introduction of good agricultural practices, improving agro-technology, stimulating innovation in the sector, increasing the level of cooperation between scientific and research institutions, legislators, and manufacturers.  8 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/sustainable-development/index_en.htm  9 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/urban-agenda 54  Climate change impacts on security of energy supply and adaptation measures are outlined in Chapters 2.3 and 3.3, which address the national targets for the energy security dimension and the measures needed to achieve them.  2.1.2  Renewable energy  i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 The indicative targets by 2030 are shown in the table below. Table 21.

Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sector The figures below show indicative RES shares in electricity (Figure 2-2), heating and cooling (Figure 2-3) and transport (Figure 2-4).  Figure 2-2. Indicative trajectories of RES share in electricity  Figure 2-3. Indicative trajectories of RES share in heating and cooling  56  The efforts of the Republic of Croatia will be directed towards achieving the target regarding the RES share in heating and cooling, and the contributions of certain technologies can be expected to be higher or lower than estimated.  Figure 2-4. Indicative trajectories of RES share in transport With regard to RES share in transport, the figure shows shares of electricity from RES, biofuels I and advanced biofuels and biogas produced from the feedstocks listed in Annex IX, Part A of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and waste cooking oil. It should be noted that the estimated contributions are the result of a simulation model and that deviations from the calculated values may be expected in the implementation. The efforts of the Republic of Croatia will be directed towards achieving the goal regarding the share of RES in direct consumption in transport, and the contributions of individual technologies can be expected to be higher or lower than presented here. iii.

Of these, 9 are accumulation power plants with a total capacity of 1,509 MW, 7 are run-of-the-river hydropower plants with a total capacity of 407 MW, 36 are small hydropower plants with a total  10 Targets are indicative - discrepancies between individual RES technologies are expected 11 By 2030, at least 50% of the installed capacity is foreseen in cogeneration power plants. 12 Not available and not planned for use 13 one aggregate at HPP Dubrovnik (126 MW) is directly connected to the transmission grid of the BiH electricity system 59  capacity of 45 MW and one is a pumped-storage hydropower plant with a capacity of 276 MW in turbine operation and 240 MW in generator operation.  By 2030, the construction of two to three large hydropower plants, several small hydropower plants (on watercourses and water supply systems) and one pumped-storage hydropower plant is expected. Revitalization of existing plants is expected to extend their life cycle with a slight increase in the power of hydropower plants. It should be noted that the estimated installed capacities are the result of a simulation model and that deviations from the calculated values may be expected in the implementation. The efforts of the Republic of Croatia will be directed towards achieving the target regarding the share of RES in gross direct consumption, and the installed capacity in some technologies can be expected to be higher or lower than estimated.  iv. Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink The estimated trajectory of demand for biomass energy broken down into heat and electricity and transport is shown in Figure 2-7.  Figure 2-7 Estimated trajectory of demand for biomass energy A study "Analysis of all data and the existing biomass balance and opinions for their improvement" is currently being developed, within the framework of which a detailed analysis of biomass consumption and origin is being carried out. The focus of the analysis is the production and use of biomass for energy generation. The results are expected at the end of 2019. 60  v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater) Under the new Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources 2018/2001 of 11th December 2018, all Member States committed to increase the share of RES for heating and cooling by 1.3 percentage points per year, or 1.1 percentage points per year if waste heat is not used, as the annual average for the period 2021-2025 and the period 2026-2030, compared to this share in 2020, expressed as a share of final consumption and according to the methodology laid down in the said document. Focusing on the sector of district heating and cooling, an increase in RES share is required at the level of 1.0 percentage points per year in the period 2021-2025 and in the period 2026-2030, compared to this share in 2020, expressed as a share of final consumption and according to the methodology laid down in the said document. However, this requirement shall also be deemed fulfilled if the heat production in cogeneration is more than 60%. As the estimated share of cogeneration in Croatian district heating and cooling systems is 79%, Croatia fulfils the requirement referred to in Article 24 of the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. Also, the increase in energy efficiency in district heating and cooling systems is already being implemented in the period until 2020 as part of the State Aid Programme for increasing the efficiency of district heating systems, and under the Operational Programme "Competitiveness and Cohesion 2014-2020", Priority Axis 4 "Promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy sources", specific objective 4c3 "Increasing the efficiency of the heating system" through the mechanism of Integrated Territorial Investment. The expected effects are a reduction in losses in distribution systems by relative 4% points on the national level by the end of 2023, and primary energy savings of 1 PJ over the same period. As planned beyond 2020, these savings will be relevant given the requirements of the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, and it is expected that the reduction in losses in district heating and cooling systems, with the assistance of ESI funds, will continue in the period until 2030. In terms of electricity generation for own needs, the largest contribution is expected from photovoltaic systems integrated in buildings. According to estimates, the installed capacity of such systems is expected to be around 300 MW in 2030. In the context of the low carbon transition, it will be particularly important to take into account a fair energy transition as well as the need for regional added value within that transition, especially in specific areas such as islands. On islands, generating electricity from RES at the place of consumption means less investment in infrastructure and greater security of the system, while helping to achieve national targets for the share of renewable energy in total production. At the heart of these efforts is the Declaration on Clean Energy for EU Islands, which recognized the importance of European islands in the decarbonization of the economy 61  and the role they could play under the Paris Agreement. Croatia, as a signatory to this document, focused on the process of decarbonisation on islands. Croatia has taken a role in exploring options to continue working on the Declaration during the EU Presidency in the first half of 2020. The main objective will be precisely defining the needs related to the energy transition and the transition to clean energy, taking into account that self-supply is promoted on the islands (both for individuals and larger projects) as well as solutions which will not further burden the transmission system and which will ensure the supply of electricity in any situation. In addition, clean transport should be additionally promoted on islands, including shipping lines which will enable better connectivity between islands and land while reducing CO 2 emissions related to ship transport. Therefore, it is important that the measures proposed in the plan specifically address the islands and the needs that the islands have in terms of electricity generation, energy efficiency and decarbonisation. This is extremely important because it encourages self-supply and the creation of renewable energy and energy communities in areas that are geographically separated from the rest of the country, while also solving the problem of increased electricity consumption during the summer months. However, the most important thing is that the promotion of measures on the islands reduces the pressure on the energy transmission system, and at the same time creates pilot projects that can then be applied to other parts of the Republic of Croatia. In addition to these measures, which will place special emphasis on the islands, additional sources of financing need to be found for the purposes of generation of clean energy on the islands and their decarbonisation, which will facilitate the transition of the islands to clean energy and accelerate their decarbonisation, taking into account the people living there
