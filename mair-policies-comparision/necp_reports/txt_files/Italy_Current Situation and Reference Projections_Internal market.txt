Figure 55- Interconnection projects planned by Terna [Source: Terna  Development Plan 2018]    Francia France Austria Austria Montenegro Montenegro Tunisia Tunisia   Furthermore, the interconnectors (pursuant to Law 99/2009) with Switzerland, Slovenia and Austria, which are at the authorisation stage, should also be taken into account. These are complemented by the merchant lines at the initiative of private parties (Reg. 14/2009), which must be taken into account by Terna so as to avoid overestimating the interconnections and overburdening the country. Compared with the number of authorisations granted, however, few merchant lines have been put in place; this therefore represents an uncertainty factor. Among these, therefore, are connections that would open up new borders (with Croatia and with Albania) or that would push the connection with Tunisia further north, towards Lazio. The list below shows the development projects for the overseas interconnection; these were identified by Terna in the Development Plan 2017. At the design stage: - HVDC connection between Italy and France (Piossasco  -voltage direct current (HVDC) terrestrial cable, of nominal power 2x600 MW, between the  - HVDC connection between Italy and Montenegro (Villanova  Tivat): two pole lines at ±500 kVcc partly in terrestrial cable and partly in marine cable, with transmission capacity of 2X600 MW, between the two Converter Stations in Cepagatti (Abruzzo) and Kotor (Montenegro); - 132 kV connection between Prati di Vizze/Brennero (IT) and Steinach (AT), in conjunction with the local Distributor.

Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity  As at 30 June 2017, the national transmission grid has a network density of over 66,000 km of lines and cables and 861 stations (source: Development Plan 2018). The network has a mainly longitudinal spread. The zone-based structure, the corresponding transit restrictions and details of the connection lines between zones are shown in the figure below. The main difficulties associated with the risks of network overload are to be found in the north-west, along the lines that transmit the imported energy from Switzerland and France and the production of hydroelectric power to the consumer centres in Liguria and Lombardy (Milan). High overloads occur in the north-east, although the commissioning of the new power line between Udine west and Redipuglia should lead to a significant reduction in transmission restrictions. The central part of the country is characterised by structural weaknesses predominantly on the Adriatic coast, which is in constant use for transmission between southern and central Italy. Journeys have increased in recent years as a result of the commissioning, in the south, of new, more efficient production capacity from conventional and renewable sources, which are destined to increase in view of new generation from renewable sources. The concentration of production from renewable sources in the areas of Avellino, Foggia and Benevento and from traditional sources in Apulia and Calabria show high numbers of journeys in the direction south  central southern predominantly on the Adriatic coast and along the high-voltage lines that branch northwards from Calabria. Other critical areas are Sardinia, due to the transmission difficulties discovered on the 150 kV network in the north-eastern area of the island (Gallura) and due to a lack of plants suitable for providing flexibility services, and Sicily, which has reduced potential in terms of transport capacity between the east and west areas of the island and difficulties in making the best use of the three underwater connections with Calabria.

In the same year, 743,000 plants were connected to the distribution networks, including 731,000 FV, with a total of 30.6 GW and gross production of 62.9 TWh, including 78.2% RES, INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 272   and an average self-consumption share of 22.4% (source ARERA [Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and Environment]).  As regards the natural gas transport network, in Italy in 2017 9,600 km of national network and 22,900 km of regional network was in operation. Natural gas distribution takes place by means of 261,000 km of network, 57.5% at low pressure, 41.8% at medium pressure and 0.67% at high pressure, 21% of which is owned by the municipalities. The number of customers served amounted to around 21.7 million domestic users, 219,000 landlords, 97,000 for public service activities and, finally, 1.5 million for other uses, with total consumption standing at 31.8 billion m3. Total net consumption, including thermoelectric generation, was 75.2 billion m3 (source ARERA  Annual survey of the regulated areas).  ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)41  -Piossasco and Italy- Montenegro). The domestic connections are identified on the basis of the following primary requirements:   reduction in congestion between market areas;  reduction in congestion between areas and restrictions on production capacity;  increase in safety and reliability in metropolitan areas;  increase in quality and safety.  Details of the actions are set out below, grouped by explanation.

Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices  Current situation of electricity markets  Wholesale markets  In Italy, GME (the energy market operator) is the entity which, pursuant to Legislative Decree No 79/1999, has the task of organising and managing the energy markets, broken down into the spot energy market in turn divided into the day-ahead market and the intraday market  and the forward electricity market with physical energy delivery obligation. GME is also the entity identified as the Nominated Electricity Market Operator (NEMO) pursuant to Commission Regulation 2015/1222 (known as the CACM Regulation).  GME is also involved  together with ARERA, Terna and the Ministry of Economic Development  in the WB6 (Western Balkan 6) project aimed at promoting the launch of regional coupling in the Balkan area on the basis of the experience gained in Italy in the organisation and management of national markets and the integrated electricity market.  The objective of the day-ahead market is to trade energy for the 24 hours of the delivery day. It is managed through hourly auctions at clearing price (system marginal price) and bids can be made starting from the ninth day before the day of delivery. The day-ahead market is a zonal market  the territory is divided into zones representing portions of the transmission grid with limited exchange capacity between them. If flows exceed the maximum transit limit allowed by cross-zonal interconnections, the price is recalculated in each zone as if each was a separate market from the others (market splitting). While bids for sale are valued in each hour at the relevant zonal price, bids to buy are valued in each hour at a National Single Price (PUN) of purchase. This is calculated as the average of the zonal prices weighted by the value of zonal purchases, net of pumping and foreign purchases. In this market, GME acts as a central counterparty for operators.  In February 2015, Multi Regional Coupling (MRC) was launched on the northern border with France, Austria and Slovenia, anticipating the implementation of the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015.  Like the day-ahead market, the intra-day market is a zonal market. Since January 2011, this market has been divided into several sessions (discrete20) with progressive closing times. The intraday market consists of seven sessions (MI1, MI2, MI3, MI4, MI5, MI6, MI7), structured as an auction with clearing price where, unlike in the day-ahead market, both bids for sale and bids to buy are valued at the zonal price. GME acts as a central counterparty for operators in this market too. Since June 2016, MI2 and MI6 sessions have been managed in coordination with the two corresponding intraday market sessions for Slovenia, within the intraday market coupling project. This has increased the efficiency of the allocation of cross-border capacity on the Slovenian border, through the shift from explicit allocation auctions to implicit allocation within these intraday market sessions managed by GME.  The Dispatching Services Market (MSD) is the platform through which Terna supplies the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 275   resources necessary for the safe management of the system by resolving intra-zonal congestion, creating reserve capacity and performing real-time balancing. Unlike other markets, it is Terna, as part of a centralised dispatching model, which in this case acts as the central counterparty of the authorised operators. The MSD is divided into a programming phase (ex-ante MSD) and the balancing market (ex-post MSD or MB). The ex-ante MSD and the balancing market take place in several sessions, as provided for in the dispatching rules. The ex-ante MSD, in particular, into six programming sub-phases (MSD1, MSD2, MSD3, MSD4, MSD5, MSD6) which take place concurrently with the intraday sessions following the publication of the results in the day-ahead market (12:55 on the day before delivery). The balancing market is organised in six sessions in which Terna selects bids referring to groups of hours on the same day in which session 24 takes place. Operators submit their bids  which Terna can accept throughout the ex-ante MSD and in the first balancing market session  in MSD1 and can subsequently modify them starting from the second balancing market session. Trading in the ancillary services market takes the form of a discriminatory auction, where each accepted bid is valued at its offer price (pay as bid). The forward electricity market is where forward contracts with an obligation to deliver and withdraw energy are traded. Trades are conducted on a continuous basis and concern two types of contracts, baseload and peakload. These can be traded for monthly (three products listed at the same time), quarterly (four products listed at the same time) and annual (one product) delivery periods.  Operators can sell and buy energy not only through  organised market, but also by entering into purchase and sale contracts concluded outside the bidding system. These contracts are in any case registered on a specific platform, the Energy Account Platform (PCE), which gives operators ample flexibility in optimising their portfolio of contracts, including bilateral contracts concluded on brokerage platforms.  Some summary quantitative data on generation and wholesale markets (year 2018  Source: ARERA Annual Report and GME Annual Report).  With a gross production of 290.6 TWh, the contribution of the main producers is shown in the figure below.  Figure 59: Contribution of major groups to gross inland production: comparison 2017-2018 [Source: ARERA] INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 276    Altri produttori Other producers The Herfindahal-Hirschman Index (HHI) on gross generation was 610, down from the 2017 figure of 638. The positive trend of recent years continued in terms of volumes traded directly on the exchange (213 TWh, +1.0%), the highest value in terms of liquidity recorded since 2010 and accounting for 72% of total trading on the day-ahead market (295.6 TWh). 269 operators are registered on the electricity trading platforms operated by GME. Volumes traded on the forward energy market remain modest (1.2 TWh). As regards the average purchase price of electricity, 2018 saw a significant recovery (61.31/MWh) with respect to 2017 (about 53/MWh). The following figure shows the trend of the PUN over time in relation to the main determinants. Provisional data for 2019, on the other hand, show a marked decline to almost 2017 levels.

This can be seen from the decrease in the market share of the leading operators (CR3 and CR5), as shown in the figure below.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 278    Figure 61: Competitiveness indicators at aggregate level [Source: GME] Retail market For data on the retail market, please refer to the data contained in the ARERA report, via the following link https://www.arera.it/it/docs/18/596-18.htm. Despite the improvement and the measures taken in recent years, there is still a gap between Italy and the other European countries in terms of the price of gas and electricity; this impacts directly on the competitiveness of companies and the purchasing power of households, particularly those living in energy poverty.  As a result of the problems that have emerged in relation to the liquidity of the marginal sources of supply of the system, for gas there is still a substantial gap in costs on the wholesale markets between VTP and TTF (Dutch trading platform); in 2017, this gap was equivalent to is reflected in final prices.  There is a general price gap in electricity compared with the European average and in particular compared with France. The reasons for this difference are: - price of gas (marginal source for Italy) still higher in main European hubs; - energy mix moved heavily towards gas combined cycle plants which, despite being more efficient, have more variable costs compared with coal-fired and nuclear plants, which are still present in significant numbers in the European energy mixes; - growth in costs for the network services; - high systems charges, due mainly to incentives for renewables and subsidies, which have seen strong growth in the last year, connected with the promotion of energy  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 279   efficiency. ii. Projections of development with current policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Realistically, it will only be possible to phase out coal and integrate renewable sources by taking account of the need for strengthening works both on the transmission and distribution networks, in as integrated and coordinated a manner as possible.  As regards the national transmission grid, the Development plan submitted by Terna in 2018, which was drawn up based on the SEN objectives, already identifies the priority actions to achieve the objectives.  In particular, the increase in production from renewable sources, the frequency of which is higher in the southern regions, causing an increase in power flows from the south to the north, requires strengthening works on this section; this work must, however, be accompanied by strengthening work on the intermediate sections (south-central south and central north-north).  the so-called Adriatic ridge, an HVDC cable between the sections of the central south and central north markets, connected to the electrical junctions of Villanova (or Villavalle) and Fano (or Porto Tolle).  The decarbonisation target is causing issues for the safety management of the Sardinian network. The option of a new connection with Sardinia (southern part) must therefore be evaluated. A first hypothesis proposed by the manager of the network is that of two new -  -and ARERA intend to carry out their own assessments.  One subject to consider is that of the coordinated development of infrastructure, for example the infrastructure between the transport of energy and rail and road transport, in order to promote multiple uses of the same infrastructure, with little impact on the country.  From this perspective, the integration of the RFI electricity network purchased by Terna will enable some of the actions already set out in the previous plans to be reviewed in the future, allowing system safety targets to be met along with the interconnection requirements with renewables.
