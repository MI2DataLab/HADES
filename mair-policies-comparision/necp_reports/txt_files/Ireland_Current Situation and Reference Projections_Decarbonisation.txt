Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors Table 19: Projected trends in GHG emissions (WEM) tCO2eq 2015 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2025 2040 ETS sector emissions  16835810 17009933 16269069 16397888 16413768 16616544 16271854 15316115 15417641 15119419 15451984 15470240 19012971 21655782 Effort Sharing sector GHG emissions  43037173 46118604 46181381 46164131 46060792 46024465 45958708 45860966 45603625 45205319 44775457 44173964 43469915 43706418 LULUCF  4519528 3483568 3770419 3962518 5808292 5003527 5376567 4645674 5187693 5354044 5747414 6649220 7867571 7577932 The EPA has produced final estimates of greenhouse gas emissions for the period 1990  Sharing Decision (ESD), 406/2009/EC1 by 5.59 Mt CO2eq. For 2018, total national greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be 60.93 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2eq). This is 0.1% lower (0.07 Mt CO2eq) than emissions in 2017 (60.65 Mt CO2 eq) and follows a 1.0% decrease in emissions reported for 2017. Emission reductions have been recorded in 7 of the last 10 years. In the last 2 years, national total emissions have only decreased by 1.2% or 0.74 Mt CO2eq, following very large increases of over 3.5% in both 2015 and 2016. In the same period, emissions in the stationary ETS sector have decreased by 12.5% or 2.22 Mt CO2eq whereas emissions under the ESD increased by 3.4% or 1.48 Mt CO2eq.  Whilst there was a reduction in emissions in 2018, due to a significant reduction in coal used for electricity generation, there were considerably large increases in residential, commercial and publibuilding stock.  Table 20: Greenhouse gas emissions for 2017 and 2018 for Ireland Mt CO2eq Mt CO2eq  2017 2018 % Change Agriculture  20.253 20.633 1.9% Transport  12.026 12.225 1.6% Energy Industries  11.899 10.631 -10.7% Residential  5.741 6.197 7.9% Manufacturing Combustion  4.565 4.741 3.9% Industrial Processes  2.270 2.316 2.0% Commercial Services  1.072 1.129 5.3% F-Gases  1.354 1.192 -11.9% Public Services  0.906 0.980 8.2% Waste  0.919 0.890 -3.2% Total  61.005 60.935 -0.1%  Agriculture remains the single largest contributor to the overall emissions at 34.0% of the total. Transport and Energy Industries are the second and third largest contributors at 20.2% and 17.1% respectively. Residential and Manufacturing Combustion emissions account for 10.2% and 7.8 % respectively. These five sectors accounted for almost 90% of national total emissions in 2018. The remainder is made up by the Industrial Processes at 3.8%, Commercial Services at 1.9%, F-Gases at 1.8%, Public Services at 1.6% and Waste at 1.5%.    170 Agriculture emissions increased by 1.9% or 0.38 Mt CO2eq in 2018 following an increase in 2017 of 2.9%. The most significant drivers for the increased emissions in 2018 are higher dairy cow numbers (+2.7%) with an increase in milk production of 4.4%. In the last 5 years, dairy cow numbers have increased by 27% and corresponding milk production by 40%. This reflects national plans to expand milk production under Food Wise 2025 and the removal of the milk quota in 2015. In 2018, there were also increased CO2eq emissions from synthetic fertiliser application on agricultural soils (+10.6%). Other cattle and sheep numbers decreased by 1.2% and 1.7% respectively, whereas pig and poultry numbers increased by 0.7% and 0.5% respectively. Total fossil fuel consumption in agriculture, forestry and fishing activities increased by 7.8% in 2018. For 2018, transport emissions increased by 1.6% in 2018 or 0.20 Mt CO2eq. This is the fifth year out of the last six with increased emissions in transport. Total energy consumption in road transport increased by 1.1% in 2018; petrol -9.2%, diesel +4.6% and biofuels -4.0%. Looking at the underlying drivers, the number of passenger diesel cars increased by 7.7% in 2018 while the number of passenger petrol cars decreased by 4.5%, commercial vehicle numbers increased by 1.7% and employment grew by 2.3% between Q4 2017 and Q4 2018. Sectoral emissions in the Energy Industries sector show a decrease of 11.7% in 2018 which is attributable to decreases in consumption of coal and peat by 43.7% and 3.3 % respectively, whilst there were increases in natural gas, oil, biomass and non-renewable wastes of 1.5%, 2.3%, 24.8% and 60.9% respectively for electricity generated. The increases in biomass and non-renewable waste were due to the new waste to energy facility in Dublin operating at full capacity in 2018. In 2018, electricity generated from wind and hydro increased by 13.6% and 0.4% respectively, reflected in a 13.6% decrease in the emissions intensity of power generation in 2018 (377 g CO2/kWh) compared with 2017 (436 g CO2/kWh). Renewables now account for 32.6% of electricity generated in 2018 (up from 29.0% in 2017). Emissions in the residential sector for 2018 increased by 7.9% or 0.46 Mt of CO2eq in 2018. Within the different fuels used in household space and water heating, all fuels showed increases; coal, peat, gasoil, kerosene, natural gas and biomass increased by 4.4%, 4.4%, 9.0%, 10.2%, 8.7% and 3.7% respectively in 2018. There were 7.6% more degree days in 2018, with all 25 weather stations showing more heating days especially during the months January to April 2018. Emissions from the Manufacturing Combustion sector increased by 3.9% or 0.18 Mt CO2eq in 2018. There were increases in combustion emissions for all sub sectors including cement which increased by 5.8% in 2018. Increased emissions from companies within the ETS were   171 evident in the chemicals, food and drink and cement sectors, with emissions increasing by 1.0%, 0.9% and 5.8% respectively. In 2018 emissions from the Industrial Processes sector continue to increase by 2.0% (0.05 Mt CO2eq) in 2018 following a 5.6% increase in 2017, mainly from increased cement production. Total process emissions from the mineral products subsector (including cement) increased by 2.7%. In 2018, total emissions (combustion and process) from the cement sector increased by 4.7% and amount to 2.91 Mt CO2eq, or 4.8% of national total emissions. Cement sector emissions have now increased by 91.2% since 2011. Emissions from Commercial Services and Public Services both increased by 5.3% and 8.2% respectively, with increases of 9.9% and 3.8% in natural gas and gasoil use in both sectors in 2018. There was a decrease in biomass/biogas use of 14.1% in commercial services and a decrease of 0.5% in public services. Emissions from the Waste sector decreased by 2.8% in 2018, with a decrease in sub category; landfills of 3.5%. Overall emissions decreased by 0.03 Mt CO2eq. Looking at longer term trends, the share of CO2 in total greenhouse gas emissions has increased to 63.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 compared to 59.3% in 1990. In contrast, CH4 and N2O emissions, primarily from the agriculture sector, have fallen from 40.6% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 to 34.7% in 2018. Emissions from F-gases account for 1.8% of the total in 2018. Between 1990 and 2018, Transport shows the greatest overall increase at 137.1%, with road transport increasing by 143.4%. Emissions increased by 1.7% in 2018, the fifth year out of the last six with increased emissions in Transport emissions. Transport emissions have decreased by 15.3% below peak levels in 2007 primarily due to the economic downturn, improving vehicle fuel efficiency due to the changes in vehicle registration tax, the increased use in biofuels and significant decreases in fuel tourism in recent years. The increase up to 2007 can be attributed to general economic prosperity, increasing population with a high reliance on private car travel as well as rapidly increasing road freight transport. Energy Industries show a decrease in emissions of 8.5% over the period 1990  2018. Over the time series, emissions from electricity generation have decreased by 10.3% whereas total electricity consumption has increased by 128.7%. Emissions from electricity generation increased from 1990 to 2001 by 54.2% and have decreased by 41.9% between 2001 and 2018. This decrease reflects the improvement in efficiency of modern gas fired power plants replacing older peat and oil-fired plants and the increased share of renewables, primarily,   172 wind power along with increased interconnectivity. This year was the lowest year in the 29-year time series for coal fired ecoal fired plant was off line from August 2018 to the second half of 2019. Emissions from Agriculture reached a peak in 1998 and have decreased to below their 1990 level since 2002, reflecting long-term decline in livestock populations and in fertiliser use due to the Common Agricultural Policy. Emissions from Agriculture in 2018 are now 1.1% above their 1990 levels and have increased for 6 out of the last 7 years.  The changes in Agriculture emissions are underpinned by higher animal numbers; in the 5-year period 2013-2018, dairy cow numbers have increased by 26.9% with a corresponding milk production by 39.8% and nitrogenous fertiliser use increased by 15.7%. This reflects national plans to expand milk production under Food Wise 2025 and the removal of the milk quota in 2015. Increased housing stock drove the gradual upward trend in the emissions from the residential sector after 1998 following a sharp reduction in the early 1990s that resulted from fuel switching to reach a peak in 2010. The 2018 emissions in this sector are 7.9% higher than 2017 levels and are 17.6% lower than their 1990 level whereas the housing stock has increased by 77% in the same period. Winter heating demand is the most important variable determining emissions from this sector with 7.6% more degree days in 2018. ii.

Agricultural projections provided by Teagasc in November 2019 which considers the impact of Food Wise 2025 for the agriculture sector.  The emissions projections that have been prepared for the National Energy and Climate Plan are projecting from the 2018 inventory baseline year (February 2020 version).  The Projections with existing policies and measures scenario assumes that no additional policies and measures, beyond those already in place by the end of 2018, are implemented.  In terms of sectors covered by the Effort Sharing Decision under this scenario Ireland is projected to cumulatively exceed its compliance obligations by approximately 13.4 Mt CO2 equivalent over the period 2013-2020.  In terms of the same sectors covered under the Effort Sharing Regulation the projections indicate that Ireland will exceed the carbon budget by approximately 32 Mt CO2 equivalent over the 2021-2030 period assuming both ETS and LULUCF flexibilities as set out in the Effort Sharing Regulation are fully utilised. If only the LULUCF flexibility were to be utilised that exceedance would increase to 50.8 Mt CO2eq. Under the Projections with existing policies and measures scenario total emissions (excluding LULULCF) are projected to decrease by 14.4% and 6.2% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels (from the 1990-2018 inventory). ETS emissions are projected to decrease by 31% and 3.4% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels. Total emissions from sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation are projected to decrease by 6.3% and 7.3% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels.  Emissions from Energy Industries (corresponding to IPCC Sector 1.A.1.) are projected to decrease by 45.4% and 20.1% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels.  Emissions from Industry (corresponding to IPCC Sector 1.A.2.) are projected to increase by 3.6% and 28.8% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels.   175  Emissions from Residential (corresponding to IPCC Sector 1.A.4.b.) are projected to decrease by 26.8% and 18% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels.  Emissions from Tertiary (corresponding to IPCC Sector 1.A.4.a.) are projected to decrease by 8.7% by 2030 and increase by 15.8% by 2040 compared to 2005 levels.  Emissions from Transport (corresponding to IPCC Sector 1.A.3.) are projected to decrease by 14% and 36.7% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels.  Emissions from Agriculture (corresponding to IPCC Sector 3.) are projected to increase by 7.7% and 9.4% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels.  Emissions from LULUCF are projected to increase by 4.2% and 18.8% by 2030 and 2040 respectively compared to 2005 levels. 4.2.2. Renewable Energy i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors Table 22: Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption Renewable Energy Shares 2018 Renewables (Total)  Of Which Hydro Wind Biomass Biogases Bioliquids Solar Heat Pumps/Geothermal Primary Energy 10.0% 0.4% 5.1% 2.8% 0.4% 1.1% 0.1% 0.3% Share of Gross Final Consumption - Renewable Directive (RES) 11.0% 0.5% 6.1% 2.4% 0.2% 1.3% 0.1% 0.4% Share of Electricity Final Consumption - (RES-E) 33.2% 2.3% 28.1% 2.1% 0.6% - 0.05% - Share of Heat Final Consumption - (RES-H) 6.5% - - 5.0% 0.2% - 0.3% 0.9% Share of Transport Final Consumption - (RES-T) 7.2% - - - - 7.1% - -  Overall and Modal Shares of Renewable Energy The contribution from renewables in 2005 was 2.8%, rising to 11% of GFC in 2018. Figure 4 below illustrates where the various renewable targets fit within overall energy use in Ireland and the progress towards those targets in 2018. Towards the right of Figure 4 the 2018 percentages of renewables are shown relative to the amount of final energy that they refer to.   176  Figure 4: Progress to renewable energy targets 2018  Figure 5: Renewable energy contribution to gross final consumption Figure 5 above shows the contribution as per the Directive methodology (2009/28/EC) from 2005 to 2018 while Figure 6 shows the renewable energy percentage contributions to gross final energy consumption by mode with RES-E normalised.    177  Figure 6: Renewable energy contribution to gross final energy consumption by mode Renewable Electricity The total contribution from renewable energy to gross electricity consumption in 2018 was 33.2% normalised (compared with 30.1% in 2017). The share of electricity from renewable energy has increased almost fivefold between 2005 and 2018  from 7.2% to 33.2%  an increase of 23 percentage points over 13 years. In absolute terms there has been a fivefold increase in the volume of renewable electricity generated from 1,873 GWh in 2005 to 10,195 GWh in 2018. Electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point that it accounted for 84% of the renewable electricity generated in 2018. Electricity generated from biomass accounted for 8.3% of renewable electricity in 2018. Biomass consists of contributions from solid biomass, landfill gas, the renewable portion of waste and other biogases.    178  Figure 7: Renewable energy contribution to gross electricity consumption by technology (RES-E normalised) Renewable Heat Figure 8 below shows the contribution from renewable energy to heat or thermal energy uses. The increasing activity in specific sub-sectors of industry, as well as some incentives and regulations for renewable systems in residential dwellings, has led to renewable energy use rising from 187 ktoe in 2005 to 310 ktoe in 2018 (a growth of 65%). In 2018 absolute amount of renewable heat energy used increased in 2018, but the share of renewable heat reduced because the use of fossil fuels increased at a faster rate than renewables did in that year. Overall between 2005 and 2018, the amount of fossil fuels used for heat has reduced by 16%, which contributed positively towards the RES-H target, as the share of renewable heat is measured against a smaller total. Following a decline in the contribution from renewables to thermal energy in the early 1990s (from 2.6% in 1990 to 2.1% in 1995), RES-H share grew between 2000 and 2014, from 2.4 % to 6.3%, and fell in 2015 to 6.2% and increasing again in 2016 and 2017 to 6.7% before small decline in 2018 to 6.5%. This overall trend in growth from 2000 has been dominated by solid biomass, mostly due to the increased use of wood waste as an energy source in the wood products and food sub-sectors of industry. In addition, recent growth in renewable energy use in the residential and services sectors can be attributed to the support of grant schemes and revisions to building regulations requiring a share of the energy demand in new dwellings to come from renewable sources.    179  Figure 8: Renewable energy contribution to thermal energy (RES-H) by technology Renewable Transport The share of renewables in transport energy (RES-T) in 2018 was 3.9%, or 7.2% when the weightings for biofuels and renewable electricity are applied in accordance with the Directive. These are a reduction on the respective 2017 figures of 4.1% and 7.4%. 16% of the required certificates for 2018 were carried forward from 2016 and 2017 as allowed for under the Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  In absolute terms, biofuels in transport increased from 1 ktoe in 2005 (0.03%) to 98 ktoe in 2011 (2.6% of transport energy). The quantity fell in 2012 to 85 ktoe mainly as a result of the majority of biodiesel qualifying for double certificates, thereby allowing the obligation to be met with certificates but causing the actual volume of biofuel to fall. Actual volumes increased again after 2013 to reach 128 ktoe (3.3% of transport energy) in 2015 but fell to 119 ktoe in 2016 (3.0% of transport energy) before increasing again in 2017 by 36% to 161 ktoe. The volume fell again in 2018, to 156 ktoe. In 2018, all the biodiesel and approximately 10% of the bioethanol used for road transport were eligible for double certificates.   180  Figure 9: Renewable energy as a proportion of (petrol and diesel) transport (RES-T) ii. Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) Overall renewable energy share in gross final consumption With Existing Measures is anticipated to be in the order of 12.8% by 2020 in the WEM (low oil price) scenario. These projections do not include the anticipated impact of policies and measures announced after the end of 2018 (the end of the latest inventory year). Ireland is likely to achieve 80% of the required progress towards the 2020 target of 16% under the Renewable Energy Directive. Progress on renewable energy has been slower than anticipated in general across Europe and purchasing compliance will come at a higher cost to the Irish Exchequer particularly in a tight market supply. In the context of 2030 renewable energy targets, the outcome is that Ireland will be starting from a point below its expected baseline of 16% from January 2021. While the commitments in the Climate Action Plan will assist in accelerating the deployment of renewable generation in the next decade, the renewable energy target is calculated as the proportion of energy consumed in the economy and electricity demand. Therefore the Irish authorities are considering the available options under the Governance Regulation and recast Renewable Energy Directive to set a cost effective pathway to meet the compliance milestones to 2030. The outlook to 2030 for the WEM (baseline) scenario suggest an outturn of 21.5% overall RES, in a low oil price scenario. As for 2030, this is a baseline scenario only and does not include the impact of more recently announced policies and measures. Refer to Part 5 of this document for a comparison of the WEM scenario to the With Additional Measures (WAM) scenario.   181  Figure 10: Overall renewable energy share in gross final consumption (WEM) Table 23 illustrates the annual trajectories for the WEM scenario assumptions. It is evident that there is a shortfall on the deployment trajectory set out in Article 4(a)(2).
