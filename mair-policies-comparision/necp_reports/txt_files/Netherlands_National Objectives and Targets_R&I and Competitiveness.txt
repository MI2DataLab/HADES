2.5 Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension i. Public and, if available, private funding for research and innovation Innovation objectives - Generic The objective of business policy is sustainable economic growth. We aim to achieve this through strengthening Dutch earning power and by tackling social challenges. Business policy is primarily generic in nature. This is to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. The Netherlands considers investments in R&D to be an important means of achieving innovation, productivity and solutions to challenges in society, by developing and absorbing knowledge and technology. R&D is a fundamental source of innovation and has major spillover effects on the economy in the form of knowledge spillovers, through which it contributes to Dutch prosperity. The Netherlands aims to invest 2.5% of GDP in R&D, in which the share of private funding will be increased. This is not a goal for 2020, but more of a medium to long-term objective. The government particularly wants to encourage private spending on research and development. Therefore, it is important to use public resources in such a way that they generate additional private R&D. To this end, the government is focusing, among other things, on further strengthening public-private partnerships, including by focusing more on the economic opportunities of social challenges within the Mission-oriented Top Sectors and Innovation policy. Innovation is encouraged through the Public-Private Partnership Allowance (PPS), Research & Development Tax Credit (Wet Bevordering Speur- en Ontwikkelingswerk, WBSO) and innovation credit, among other things. The policy also increases access to capital market funding, ensures a healthy business climate and attracts foreign investment, alleviates regulatory burden and helps parties make use of the opportunities provided by digitisation and increased sustainability. Th2020. The main objectives will concern alignment with the needs of the market, public-private partnerships and strengthening SMEs in innovation policy. In addition the focus is on economic opportunities offered by social challenges. Consequently Dutch innovation policy aims to increase prosperity and maintain the Netherlands' competitive position. Expenditure on research, development and the demonstration of new technologies should partly form the basis of new economic activities. The decrease in the cost of technology plays a key role in this regard.                                                   75 https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0030164/2018-05-01 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Innovation objectives - Top sector policy Specific innovation policy focuses on nine so-called "top sectors". These are clusters of companies and knowledge institutions in which entrepreneurs, researchers and public authorities collaborate on international competition strategies, earning power and innovation. The Letter to Parliament on the revision of top sector policy76 indicated that the Dutch Top Sectors intend to focus more on the economic opportunities of four social themes (in addition to the focus on the formulated key technologies). See list below:   "Energy transition and sustainability" is one of the four social themes. Two sub-themes fall under this theme: climate & energy and the circular economy. Missions were formulated and adopted by the government for these four social themes in a broad stakeholder process. The top sectors then compiled five thematic knowledge and innovation agendas on the basis of these missions and an overarching sector-specific knowledge and innovation agenda. This is an important step towards mission-oriented innovation policy, which means that knowledge and innovation questions are explicitly expressed in relation to the missions and are also placed in a broader perspective of public and private deployment (more than just innovation, but also, for example, market creation, legislation and regulations, etc.). In many cases this demands an integral approach and cooperation across the different sectors. The missions and the knowledge and innovation agendas drafted will define the innovation approach and the deployment of resources by research institutes, top sectors and departments. Innovation targets - Energy and Climate The challenge to achieve a climate-neutral society and a reliable, affordable, secure and low CO2 energy supply by 2050 is very extensive. Innovation is essential to implement this transition in a responsible and affordable manner. Investments in innovation could result in new knowledge that allows the target of 95% CO2 reduction by 2050 to be achieved more economically than with existing technologies. Low CO2 options are often more expensive than the fossil options available and require major system changes to allow the transition to a low CO2 economy. This requires the integration of many different technologies, changes to the necessary infrastructure and knowledge, changes to the corresponding business models and other roles for the parties involved. For these reasons, investments in low CO2 innovations cannot be taken for granted. Targeted energy and innovation policy encourages the necessary innovations for the energy and climate targets and offer economic opportunities. As described in Chapter 1, an important step is taken as a result of the Climate Agreement in shaping Dutch energy and climate policy for 2030 up to 2050. Mission-oriented innovation policy has been implemented with the accompanying Integrated Knowledge and Innovation Agenda for Climate and Energy (March 2019). Based on the missions formulated by the sectoral platforms for 2050 and the specific targets for 2030, the agenda describes the knowledge and innovation tasks these challenges involve. These knowledge and innovation tasks have been bundled in the Integrated Knowledge and Innovation Agenda (IKIA), in which a good balance has been achieved between a focus on the short term (development, demonstration and roll-out) and on the medium and long term (research and development). The agenda thus also makes it possible to achieve the targets (including intermediate) in 2030 and at the same time provides the necessary basis for achieving the missions for 2050. The knowledge and innovation tasks to help achieve a mission usually require a long-term commitment to a programmatic approach. In the agenda this resulted in 13 Multi-annual Mission-oriented Innovation Programmes, in which a connection is made to international developments and commitment at the European level with the SET plan and at the global level with the IEA and the technology cooperation partnerships as well as Mission Innovation. The IKIA with the 13 MMlPs thus determines the course for the required knowledge and innovation commitment in the field of climate and energy. Therefore, the IKIA implements government policy to focus on societal challenges in innovation policy (mission-oriented top sector and innovation policy)7677 and the development at European level with Horizon Europe.                                                   76 Letter to Parliament on "Mission-oriented innovation policy with impact", 13 July 2018, "Mission-oriented Top Sectors and innovation policy", 26 April 2019. 77 Letters to Parliament: "Mission-oriented innovation policy with impact", 13 July 2018, "Mission-oriented Top Sectors and innovation policy", 26 April 2019.

This means that the potential contribution to the established tasks and cost effectiveness (over time) are key when formulating the 13 MMIPs as well as for the specific related commitment. Naturally, the international position the Netherlands occupies (knowledge institutions, business community) in these fields is also relevant in determining the specific commitment within the MMIPs and the use of economic opportunities (make or buy). The involvement of the business community is crucial, given that it ultimately concerns the production of new technologies, goods and services, which companies can use to do business. Depending on the phase in the innovation process, this will mean more in-kind commitment and marginal financial contribution in fundamental research and development, increasing to greater financial contributions for pilots and demonstrations. The private contribution will lag behind, particularly with regard to system issues. This translates into a target figure of on average 40% of private contributions to the IKIA and MMIPs. The mission-orientated top sectors and innovation policy primarily focuses on the economic opportunities of the social challenges, including the energy transition and sustainability. The annual available resources for all MMIPs are:  Public:    The estimate of the available resources for 2020 is based on the KIC, the Knowledge and Innovation Covenant. The needs assessment comes from the above-mentioned Multi-annual Mission-oriented Innovation Programmes that have been drawn up together with knowledge institutions and companies. Establishing the investment required is complicated. The requirement mentioned above has not been validated, but there are signs that the requirement exceeds the resources available. ii. Promoting technology in the field of clean energy, the long-term roll-out of low-carbon technologies and the corresponding infrastructure for transporting and storing carbon Innovation target for transporting and storing carbon, and carbon conservation in the chain The government regards CCS as an inevitable transition technology for reducing CO2 emissions in sectors where no cost-effective alternative is available in the short term.78 In addition to the use of CCS for emission reductions in industry, CCS could, in the future, play an important role in achieving negative emissions and pave the way for the development of green hydrogen and CCU. CCS policy is currently being developed using the Climate Agreement as a basis. Biomass and bio-based products play a major role with regard to carbon conservation in the chain, particularly in industry and agriculture. For industry, an MMIP has been formulated that focuses on closing industrial cycles. Knowledge and innovation issues recur in the field of circular and bio-based raw materials and products, the design and embedding of new circular chains as well as the application of CCS and social acceptance. The circular economy policy formulated in the state-wide programme for a "Circular Economy by 2050" and the Raw Materials Agreement focuses on reusing raw materials, including biomass, and contributes to a low CO2 industry by 2050. In addition, within the mission-oriented top sectors and innovation policy, a separate mission and a knowledge and innovation agenda have been compiled for the Circular Economy under the social theme of the energy transition & sustainability. The mission defined by the government for the Circular Economy is: "A sustainably-oriented, fully circular economy in 2050. The target for 2030 is to halve raw material consumption." iii. Competitiveness The competitiveness of the Dutch economy is an important focal point for the Dutch government. With its ambitious climate and energy policy, the Netherlands assumes responsibility for combating climate change as much as possible. But also views it as a necessity and an opportunity to make our economy more sustainable and to safeguard our prosperity and earning capacity. By starting the ball rolling earlier, we can build up a lead compared to other countries. It means we will have more time and can develop new ideas and technologies that we can subsequently export. Consequently, we are simultaneously working on a more attractive business climate. In particular the Netherlands, as a prosperous and innovative country, can succeed in increasing prosperity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. This is being implemented on several levels. Firstly, by focusing top sector and innovation policy on the social challenges and the                                                  78 Letter to Parliament on the proposal for a Climate Agreement, 28 June 2019, Parliamentary document 32 813 no. 342 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    economic opportunities that these challenges entail. The choice of the required knowledge and innovation, the formulation of the 13 MMIPs as well as the specific related commitment take into account the international position of the Netherlands, as well as the opportunities that the commitment offers for earning capacity. As yet, however, no specific national objectives have been formulated in this regard. At the forefront of this commitment are the potential contribution to the missions and the cost effectiveness (over time). Secondly, with regard to competitiveness, the focus on the labour market, education and employment is important. Boosting the labour market and education policy, as formulated in the advice issued by the Social and Economic Council (SER) from 2018, is79 an important pillar for achieving a successful transition to a sustainable economy and is necessary for capitalising on opportunities for the economy and employment, and for absorbing social risks such as job losses in fossil-oriented sectors. In discussions on the Climate Agreement, a specific task group was appointed for this topic including representatives from the social partners. Policy commitments included in the Climate Agreement (and the Climate Plan) are described in section 3.5.                                                 79 SER (2018), Energy transition and employment.
