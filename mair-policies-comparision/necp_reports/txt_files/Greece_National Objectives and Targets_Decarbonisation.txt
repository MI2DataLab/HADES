38 Chapter 2 NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 2.1 Overview of final NECP objectives and comparison against the initial draft The Greek government intends to use the NECP as the key tool for developing its national energy and climate policy for the following decade, taking into account the recommendations and the UN sustainable development goals. energy and addressing climate change, and provision has been made for a specific roadmap for attaining specific quantitative and qualitative objectives, which will outline policy priorities and measures in a wide range of development and financial activities for the benefit of the society. ergy and climate objectives and priorities, which are taken into account in drawing up and implementing the NECP, consist in attaining the following:  an integrated model for sustainable and viable growth in all economic sectors;  combined energy sector development and environmental protection through bold measures for addressing climate change;  choosing energy policies with the most cost-benefit ratio for energy transition;  waste management and utilisation by the use of state-of-the-art circular economy technologies;  security and security of supply;  ensuring the strategic diversification of energy imports, while at the same time modernising and developing energy infrastructures and putting an end to the energy isolation of the islands;  setting up attractive investment environment to support energy transition, focusing on innovation and new technologies;  ensuring the maximum possible use of community resources and mechanisms; and  ensuring openness and innovation in order to achieve growth that will create new jobs.   39 In view of the above, the main objective of the National Energy and Climate Plan is to design, plan and implement socially and environmentally efficient and cost-effective policy measures that will help attain the medium- and long-term national energy and climate objectives, will contribute to economic growth in Greece and will also respond to the challenge of reducing energy costs and, in general, of protecting end users from high prices of energy products and services. These national energy and climate targets for 2030 are developed by taking into account both specific quantitative obligations undertaken by Greece as a Member State (i.e. targets for non-ETS sectors and for the reduction of national emissions of certain air pollutants compared to 2005) and the characteristics and specificities of our national energy system, the domestic potential for developing technologies and applications, the potential for adaptation, as well as -economic characteristics. This process results in adapting the national objectives to the corresponding core EU ones (i.e. the objectives for sectors that are part of the emissions trading scheme, RES, energy savings), which are finally proposed under this national plan. Furthermore, the main quantitative policy objectives set in the context of the national energy 2050, given that the Greek government aims to participate in the commitment for a climate neutral economy at an EU level. More specifically, the Government is revising the objective for the RES share in gross final energy consumption by 2030 from 31%, as stated in the initial NECP draft, to at least 35% by 2030. Please note that the current RES share in gross final energy consumption is approximately 18%2. As regards power generation in particular, RES will be the major domestic source of power as early as in the middle of the following decade, with a share exceeding 65% of the domestic power generation by 2030 and 60% of the gross final electricity consumption, by utilising in the most cost-ts. A tool in this direction will be the full functioning of the new electricity market model, the simplification and speeding up of the licensing procedure, the digitisation of the energy system and the enhancement and expansion of energy infrastructures to allow for maximum RES penetration in power generation, focusing on storage systems, and in general the gradual                                                            2  40 electrification and the energy coupling of final consumption sectors to allow for maximum RES share in final energy consumption. Another priority is promoting electromobility, which will now rely heavily on RES power generation, while at the same time ensuring considerable energy savings through improved energy efficiency. The NECP and the strategic plan for promoting electromobility, which is also an energy priority for the government, also fall in this context. The aim is also to put an end to the energy isolation of our islands by early 2029 at the latest and to have them interconnected with the mainland system, thus eliminating the utility services costs, as well as to have innovative hybrid RES power generation systems set up on those islands that will not be interconnected or will be interconnected later on, for the benefit of all consumers. At the same time, further using RES to cover thermal and cooling needs, in buildings in particular, promoting dispersed RES generation and advanced biofuels in transport are some of the priorities laid down in the NECP, and specific targets are being set in that context. As far as improved energy efficiency is concerned, it should be stressed that it is a core horizontal priority and is essentially the first axis on which all other policies are planned, given that it is a necessary condition for implementing the policies through specific measures in an economically and socially optimal manner in all final areas of consumption and themes. Moreover, improving energy efficiency is a key horizontal priority with multiple benefits, such as reducing GHG emissions, cutting down on energy costs, ensuring better comfort conditions in buildings and in public spaces, increasing added value and employment and improving the competitiveness of businesses. As far as the energy efficiency improvement implement an optimal combination of regulatory interventions and financial instruments in order to allow for utilising the potential for energy savings and making sure that final energy consumption in 2030 is limited to the 2017 levels3 and is much lower than the corresponding target for 20204. The performance in respect of the above two indicators, which are the indicators used to assess Member States for this dimension, will ensure the attainment of the energy efficiency improvement objective of 38% in relation to the methodology used for the core EU objective.                                                            3 Reduction of 1.5% - 3.6% based on the results of the two energy simulations. 4 Reduction of 10.3% - 12.2% based on the results of the two energy simulations. 41 To attain this objective, specific measures are being planned for buildings with a view to implementing an ambitious plan for the renovation and improvement of the energy efficiency of the stock of public buildings through the participation of energy service companies (ESCOs) and the renewal of end-of-lifecycle buildings. Plans are also being made for providing targeted incentives for energy efficiency improvement interventions in the stock of private buildings by adopting an ambitious strategy for the renovation of the building stock in its entirety, to make sure that 12-15% of the buildings have undergone energy renovation by 2030. Similarly, measures are being planned for the industrial and transport sectors, focusing on specific energy consumptions and uses for which energy efficiency improvement and energy savings actions with a high cost-effectiveness per energy benefit unit ratio can be implemented, along with a change to the urban mobility model, consisting in reducing the use of private vehicles and  Special measures and incentives are also being planned for the bioclimatic upgrade of the urban public space in order to reduce the urban heat island effect by 20% by 2030. Another priority consists in the optimal use of available public and private financial instruments with a view to ensuring maximum benefits for final consumers, taking due account of the specificities of each category of final consumers and of the characteristics of the energy interventions considered as optimal. A major objective in the context of the new revised government strategy for the NECP is the highly ambitious, as well as realistic, programme for sharply and definitively reducing the share of lignite in power generation, i.e. the so-called lignite phase-out, by implementing a relevant front-loaded programme in the following decade, also given that all the lignite-fired thermal power plants currently in operation are to be shut down by 2023, and putting a complete end to the use of lignite for power generation in Greece by 2028. This objective also incorporates rationalise power generation costs in Greece now.   42 The lignite phase-out plan for power generation in Greece also involves adopting integrated programmes for supporting lignite-producing areas in Greece, to smooth out the transition to the post-lignite era. More specifically, the Greek government has been committed to shutting down lignite-fired plants by 2028 in a well-coordinated and responsible manner. Maintaining jobs and utilising the increased know-how of human resources in these areas are a top priority. Clearly, these revised quantitative energy objectives of the NECP will consequently contribute to a further reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and will make Greece stand out as one of the Member States that have adopted ambitious climate objectives. Moreover, a core objective in the context of the revised NECP consists in attaining a GHG emission reduction of more than 56% compared to 2005, against a corresponding EU objective of approximately 36% (adjustment of the EU objective of 40% compared to 1990). Through its long-standing strategy, the government has supported the effort made towards a climate neutral economy, aiming to improve the competitiveness of the economy and of businesses, to create new jobs and to strengthen the role of consumers and the overall functioning of competitive energy markets for the benefit of society. Table 2 summarises the revised and more ambitious national objectives both compared to those of the initial NECP draft and the corresponding EU ones.   43 Table 2: Summary of national objectives in the context of the NECP. Year of objective: 2030 Final NECP Initial NECP draft New NECP objectives compared to EU objectives RES share in gross final energy consumption  31% More ambitious than the corresponding core EU objective of 32% RES share in gross final electricity consumption 61-64% 56%  Final energy consumption 16.1-16.5 Mtoe  to the 2007 predictions) 18.1 Mtoe (32%)  (referring to 17.3 Mtoe without ambient heat) More ambitious than the corresponding core EU objective of 32.5% and attainment of the objective on the basis of a new EU indicator for reducing consumption compared to 2017 Share of lignite in power generation 0% 16.5%  Reduced GHG to 1990,  to 2005 33% compared to 1990,  49% compared to 2005 Identical with core EU objectives and overperformance compared to national commitments in non-ETS sectors Another priority of the NECP in terms of policies planned and of the implementation of specific measures is to attain specific objectives regarding the security of energy supply, the functioning of energy markets and the role of consumers, to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy and to promote research and innovation actions. In this context, other individual national objectives are also being developed on the basis of specific thematic policy axes, taking due account of the individual potential, technical specificities and qualitative characteristics of the Greek energy system in the fields of energy generation, distribution and consumption and the overall structure of the Greek economy. These qualitative objectives are broken down into the following key categories: 1. Objectives to strengthen interconnectivity and security of energy supply.   44 2. Objectives and timetables for liberalised and competitive energy markets. 3. Objectives and timetables for the optimal development and functioning of the energy system and energy infrastructures for the benefit of users. 4. Objectives of protecting and strengthening the role of consumers. 5. Objectives of changing consumption patterns and using energy-efficient and low-emission fuels in final consumption sectors. 6. Objectives of strengthening the competitiveness of the national economy. 7. Objectives of promoting research and innovation in environmental and energy issues. It should be pointed out that a necessary horizontal condition for attaining all these objectives and priorities of the energy plan is to mobilise significant investment funds both from the private and public sector and to combine the use of specialised financing mechanisms and market mechanisms to allow for the cost- and time-effective implementation of the measures and policies planned in terms of specific projects and interventions. The following chapter sets out the key policy priorities for each dimension of the National Climate and Energy Plan, which are deemed necessary for attaining these objectives. These policy priorities are the axes for planning and applying/implementing specific policy measures under each dimension. All these policy priorities and the specific measures resulting from their implementation are part of an integrated plan for the optimal attainment of the national energy, environmental, socio-economic and development objectives, which requires consistency, horizontal combination and coordination in monitoring the priorities and implementing the measures. 2.1.1 Revised NECP: Ambitious and realistic objectives This section compares the results of the initial National Energy and Climate Planning (NECP) draft published in January 2019 against those of the final NECP draft, which incorporates the latest political commitments. The new modified objectives lead to a new forecast of the development of the energy system, with different results in terms of the structure and share of fuels and technologies. Table 3 shows the evolution of the key energy system values for 2030 for either resolution by the use of suitable energy models. The results that are based on the revised objectives of the final NECP for 2030 are marked with higher RES penetration shares in gross and final energy consumption, a greater energy efficiency improvement that translates into lower forecasts of 45 final energy consumption, and a zero share of lignite-fired plants in power generation. A more detailed description of these differences is given in the graphs below in this section. Table 3: Comparison of the key energy system results for 2030, between the original and final NECPs. Comparative table Initial NECP Final NECP Core indicators   Total GHG emissions (MtCO2eq) 71 60.6 RES share in gross final energy consumption [%] 31% 35% RES share in final consumption for heating and cooling [%] 32% 43% RES share in gross electricity consumption [%] 56% 61% RES share in final consumption for transport [%] 20% 19% Energy productivity [EUR million '10/ktoe] 9.98 11.03 Energy consumption   Gross domestic consumption 23.02 22.19 Primary energy consumption [Mtoe] 22.26 20.55 Final energy consumption [Mtoe] 18.04 17.38 Final energy consumption (without ambient heat) [Mtoe] 17.32 16.51 Power generation   Installed capacity [GW]   Lignite 2.70 0.00 Natural Gas 5.40 6.91 Wind farms 6.60 7.05 Photovoltaics 6.80 7.66 Total installed RES capacity for power generation 17.70 19.03 Gross power generation [TWh] 57.37 57.93 Net power generation [TWh] 55.56 57.22 Lignite 9.03 0.00 Petroleum products 1.54 0.835 Natural Gas 10.26 18.30 Bioenergy 1.74 1.58 Hydro 6.27 6.60 Wind farms 15.51 17.21 Photovoltaics 10.34 11.82                                                            5 It concerns almost exclusively power generation in the energy sector, refineries in particular 46 Solar thermal 0.26 0.26 Geothermal 0.63 0.63 Net power generation from fossil fuels [TWh] 20.80 19.13 NET electricity imports [TWh] 4.16 4.58 Total electricity supply [TWh]6 59.72 61.80 Final electricity consumption [TWh] 54.32 56.4 Buildings   Total number of residential buildings renovated by 2030 400,000 600,000 With regard to the share of the RES in the energy system, the revised NECP has provided for a much higher RES share in the energy system, both overall and in individual sectors. This significantly higher RES share results from new policy measures and from the commitment to gradually reduce the use of lignite-fired plants for power generation up until they are all shut down by 2028. This decision creates space for the installation of additional RES plants, also strengthening the role of the gas-fired plants that will provide the necessary system flexibility. The additional output of gas-fired and RES plants compared to lignite-fired plants also has an impact on overall GHG emissions, which will decrease by a significant 17%. There is also reduced own-consumption in power generation, as RES plants, typically replacing lignite-fired plants, have significantly lower own-consumption levels. This plan presents a further improvement in energy efficiency and ultimately a reduction in final energy consumption of about 3.6% - 4.7% compared to the objective set in the initial NECP, depending on the methodology used. Please note that, as also explained in the chapter that contains the detailed results, the forecast of the energy system development with the second energy model used, in addition to the first one that had been used in the initial NECP draft, also includes an even higher estimated contribution of the policy measures planned towards energy efficiency improvement and a final consumption reduction rate of over 6.5%. In this respect, particular emphasis will be placed on measures for the energy upgrading and renovation of the building stock in the scenario for attaining the objectives.                                                              6 The total electricity supply is defined as the sum of the net power generation and net electricity imports. 47 More specifically, the total number of buildings or building units to be renovated by 2030 is expected to reach 600 000, compared to an estimated 400 000 in the initial NECP draft. More specifically, it should be noted that, if ambient energy used by heat pumps and considered as RES is not taken into account for the calculation of final energy consumption (according to the method used to calculate the relevant balances by 2016), the energy savings achieved are 4.7% higher than those of the initial NECP draft. Finally, as far as the transport sector and the RES share are concerned, this draft has, at an energy simulation level, retained a high estimate of the Greek data relating to the share of electromobility in passenger transport, but has set a new more substantial objective with respect to the share of electric passenger vehicles in new registrations in 2030. More specifically, taking into account the detailed description of the characteristics and capabilities of the domestic market in passenger cars, as detailed in Chapter 3, and the assumptions taken into account in the energy model simulations, a new objective has been set in the context of the NECP for a 30% share of electric passenger vehicles in new registrations in 2030. This objective, as detailed in following sections, is still ambitious, but also realistic if we take into account the actual data of the domestic market in vehicles. It should be stressed that, to ensure the completeness of the policies described, intermediate targets are also set in terms of the share of electric vehicles in new registrations, which were not included in the initial NECP draft (described in Chapter 3), thus establishing a more thorough and detailed approach to promoting electromobility, on the basis of realistic assumptions of the domestic market. The aim is to monitor the development of the domestic market in electric vehicles on the basis of the measures and incentives described in the respective section of Chapter 3, with a view to using the actual share of electric vehicles in new registrations as a basis for revising the results of energy simulations with regard to the share of electric vehicles in the entire fleet of passenger vehicles. An additional aim is to reduce the use of private vehicles (in urban areas in particular) and replace it with the use of public transport, bicycles, micro-mobility vehicles and walking. The following graphs and tables show the results of the two approaches to: (i) the shares of RES in final consumption both in the key sectors and overall, (ii) the formulation of the power generation mix, (iii) the resulting emission reduction levels, and (iv) the comparative evolution of final energy consumption and the breakdown of the absolute and weighted increase in energy efficiency improvement, as well as a comparison of the use of fuels in final energy 48 consumption. As regards RES shares for 2030, percentage values in this draft are significantly increased compared to those of the initial draft (Chart 1). More specifically, an objective for a 35% RES share in final consumption leads to an increase in shares by 33% in heating and cooling and by 9% in gross electricity consumption, where a share of at least 61% is expected. There is a significant difference observed in the results of the two approaches in respect of the forecast of the total GHG emissions for 2030 (Chart 2). More specifically, the revised plan contains a forecast of 60.6 MtCO2eq of total GHG emissions, compared to a forecast of 71 MtCO2eq in the initial draft. In fact, the decrease compared to 1990 and 2005 is almost 43% (42.6%) and 56%, respectively. This difference reflects the diversification of the energy mix, i.e. an increase in the use of RES and gas-fired plants and a reduction in the use of diesel-fired plants and the shutdown of lignite-fired plants.  Chart 1: Comparing the share of RES plants for 2030, between the initial and final NECP drafts.   49  Chart 2: Comparing total GHG emissions for 2030, between the initial and final NECP drafts, with reference to emissions of 1990 and 2005. The fuel mix is also diversified considerably between the two drafts (Chart 3). The greatest difference consists in shutting down all lignite-fired plants instead of reducing them, as provided for in the initial draft. The consumption of lignite for power generation purposes will cease altogether in 2028, and the use of RES (wind farms and photovoltaics in particular) will increase considerably. There is also a significant increase in the share of natural gas in the energy mix, as new plants are to replace part of the output of lignite-fired plants and provide the system with the flexibility required by the increased share of uncontrollable RES plants. There is also a sharp decrease is the share of diesel-fired plants, owing to their ever-increasing operating cost, which makes them non-competitive in relation to RES technologies, but primarily owing to speeding up the interconnection of almost all non-interconnected islands with the mainland system in the period under consideration, compared to the initial NECP draft, and the extended use of RES hybrid systems on the very few islands which are not to be interconnected.   50  Chart 3: Comparing the share of fuels in net power generation for 2030, between the initial and final NECP drafts. Table 4 and Chart 4 show the difference in the share of each sector or fuel, respectively, in final energy consumption, as calculated in the original draft and in this revised NECP draft, for 2030. There is a considerable difference in final consumption in the domestic sector, as the decrease in final consumption is improved by 9.3% compared to the reduction in consumption foreseen in the initial NECP, as well as in the industrial sector, where the improvement in energy efficiency simulated in the final NECP is increased by 6% compared to that of the initial NECP. As regards other sectors, i.e. tertiary and transport, there are no substantial differences between the initial and final NECP drafts in terms of the percentage change in final consumption, whereas the estimated final consumption is expected to increase in 2030 compared to 2020 in absolute values. Table 4: Change in final energy consumption per sector for the years 2020-2030.  Initial NECP - Change in final energy consumption in 2020-2030 Final NECP - Change in final energy consumption in 2020-2030 Difference between the initial and final NECPs Weighted difference between the initial and final NECPs Industry 1.7% -4.4% 6.0% 1.1% Residential -0.4% -9.7% 9.3% 2.3% Tertiary 0.6% 1.2% -0.6% -0.1% Transport 1.3% 1.0 % 0.3 % 0.1 % Total 1.2% -2.5% 3.7% 3.7%   51 As regards fuels in final consumption, there is major change in petroleum products, natural gas and solid fuels, whose consumption is reduced by approximately 8% (700 ktoe), 13% (260 ktoe) and 34% (80 ktoe), respectively. There is a slight increase in electricity consumption, in the direct use of RES and in ambient heat, through heat pumps.  Chart 4: Final consumption per fuel for 2030, in accordance with the initial and final NECPs. Following is a detailed description of the objectives and targets for each dimension of the NECP. 2.2 Climate change, emissions and removals of greenhouse gases 2.2.1 Objectives The main objective of the NECP is to provide a roadmap for a substantial reduction in GHG emissions compared to specific reference years, thus demonstratcomply with the core EU targets for protecting the environment and addressing climate change for the benefit of people and of the society in general. In this context, the NECP includes general and specific objectives for Greece, which are very ambitious and much higher than the binding objectives laid down in the context of EU obligations.   52 More specifically, a core objective is set for a total 40% reduction in GHG emissions in Greece in 2030 compared to 1990, whereas the reduction objective compared to 2005, which is more comparable on the basis of the Greek economy levels and the related emissions at European level, exceeds 55%. Moreover, with regard to non-ETS sectors, the reduction in GHG emissions exceeds 35.4% compared to the corresponding emission levels of 2005, thus the reduction rate being double that of the national commitment, which was least 16%. Respectively, with regard to ETS sectors and uses, the estimated rate of reduction in GHG emissions under the NECP is over 70% compared to 2005, while it is much higher compared to the overall EU objective for reducing GHG emissions (almost 43% compared to the corresponding emission levels of 2005) (Table 5). Table 5: Evolution of the reduction in national GHG emissions for 20307. Evolution of the reduction in GHG emissions  (% reduction) 2020 2022 2025 2027 2030 Reduction in emissions for ETS sectors and uses compared to 2005 52% 62% 65% 67% 74% Reduction in emissions for non-ETS sectors compared to 2005 30% 31% 33% 34% 36% Total reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2005 41% 47% 50% 52% 56% Total reduction in GHG emissions compared to 1990 23% 31% 34% 36% 43%                                                              7 In the above forecasts for the evolution of GHG emissions, account is also taken of the ETS part of international air transport. 53 In addition to that, the NECP integrates and adopts the quantitative targets set in the context of the implementation of Directive 2016/2284/EC on the reduction of national emissions of certain air pollutants for the period 2020-2029 and for 2030 compared to 2005 (as shown in Table 6), which also requires the development, establishment and implementation of national air pollution control programmes, as well as the monitoring and reporting of the emission levels for relevant pollutants [sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)] and other pollutants (CO, heavy metals, POPs, BC). It should be noted that these emissions are not simulated or further analysed in the context of the NECP, as monitoring their evolution is an obligation of other national emission inventories and of the National Programme for the Control of Air Pollution, which is being developed in 2019, further analysing the impact of the NECP on the attainment of the objectives set for Greece under Directive 2016/2284/EC. Table 6: Quantitative targets for reduction in national emissions of certain air pollutants for the period 2020-2029 and for 2030 compared to 2005. Air pollutants Percentage of emission reductions compared to 2005 Period 2020-2029 2030 Sulphur dioxide (SO2) 74% 88% Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 31% 55% Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) 54% 62% Ammonia (NH3) 7% 10% Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) 35% 50% With regard to climate change adaptation, Greece has already developed and adopted by means of Law 4414/20 the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change, which sets out the general objectives, guidelines and means of implementation of a modern, effective and developmental climate change adaptation strategy within the framework set by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, EU directives and international experience.   54 The National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change is a strategic document aimed at providing guidelines and as such, does not analyse in depth the necessary sectoral policies, but includes indicative actions and adjustment measures for 15 sectoral policies: Agriculture and stock farming, forest ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystems, aquaculture, fisheries, water resources, coastal zones, tourism, energy, infrastructure and transport, health, built environment, extractive industries, cultural heritage, insurance sector, without prioritising the corresponding measures and actions. These topics will serve as the substance of the Regional Plans for Adaptation to Climate Change, which will specify the guidelines of the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change by defining the immediate adaptation priorities at regional/local level. That is, the Regional Plans for Adaptation to Climate Change will precisely define, based on the climatic conditions and vulnerability of each region, the priority policy areas and geographic units for taking measures, and will also specify these measures, as well as the financial instruments for the implementation of the measures, the implementing bodies, the stakeholders, etc. The Greek regions are currently in the process of elaborating their own Regional Plans for Adaptation to Climate Change (with different degrees of maturity per Region). This effort is being assisted by the European programme Life IP  implementation of adaptation policy across 8. This 8-year  programme is coordinated by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, with the participation of 19 bodies, including, inter alia,  the Academy of Athens, the National Technical University of Athens, the Bank of Greece, as well as various Greek regions and municipalities. The aim of the programme is to support both the planning process and the implementation of the necessary adaptation measures at national, regional and local levels and to serve as leverage for mobilisation in order to facilitate effective adaptation to the impact of climate change in the following years. Promoting circular economy and bioeconomy: Circular economy and bioeconomy will play a major role in the productive restructuring of Greece, with a clear regional dimension. The contribution of circular economy and bioeconomy towards attaining climate change mitigation objectives is considered to be particularly important, as it has been estimated that shifting to a circular pattern can lead to a significant reduction in GHG emissions through recycling and reuse of materials, more efficient use of resources and more eco-friendly product design, as well as                                                            8 www.adaptivegreece.gr 55 the Greek economy due to the numerous opportunities and possibilities for resource utilisation, but also due to the changes that can cover a broader part of the economy, in the field of waste management in particular. The National Circular Economy Strategy, adopted by the Central Economic Policy Council on 17 April 20189, aims precisely at accelerating circular economy actions and unlocking growth potential, including a series of actions for the development of financial instruments, the planning and establishment of a regulatory framework and regulations, while at the same time removing bureaucratic obstacles, linking small and medium-sized entrepreneurship and social economy to technological innovation and improving governance and networking, as well as accelerating applications. 2.2.2 Challenges The most important challenge for the majority of policy measures is to effectively address the complexity of different components (technical, administrative, managerial, institutional, social) that need to be addressed in order to properly implement the specific policy measures. The lack of necessary infrastructure is a major challenge for the implementation of actions at a number of levels, e.g. the lack of necessary infrastructure for promoting the use of gas in transport or the effective management of waste streams. With regard to the reduction in emissions of fluorinated gases, it is necessary to intensify and coordinate the existing control and sanctioning mechanisms. In the case of policy measures relating to the agricultural sector, the main challenge lies in the need to inform and integrate a large number of producers of agricultural products, as there are numerous small- and medium-capacity producers active in Greece. Finally, the absence of control and certification procedures poses an obstacle to the proper implementation of policy measures for reducing fluorinated gas emissions and of other policy measures. In some cases, there is also an absence of a regulatory and statutory framework that would facilitate the implementation of policy measures, and in that respect all necessary legislative and regulatory instruments and tools will be adopted in the context of implementing the NECP, to make possible the attainment of the objectives hereunder.                                                              9 http://www.opengov.gr/minenv/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kykliki_oikonomia.pdf 56 2.3 Renewable energy sources 2.3.1 Objectives The national objective to be attained in terms of the RES share in gross final energy consumption is at least 35%. Please note that the share of heat pumps for covering cooling needs in an a more energy-efficient manner is not yet taken into account in this share as RES contribution, owing to methodology-related reasons, as the necessary EU technical guidelines have not been issued yet. There are also objectives for the RES share in gross final electricity consumption to reach at least 60%, the RES share in covering heating and cooling needs to exceed 40% and the RES share in the transport sector to exceed 14% in line with the relevant EU calculation methodology. These quantitative objectives translate, depending on the evolution of final consumption, into specific quantitative values either in terms of installed capacity or in terms of a number of RES technologies/systems in final use (e.g. penetration of biofuels in transport, biomass boilers to cover heating and domestic hot water needs, heat pumps in buildings to cover heating and cooling needs, solar-thermal systems, etc.). Consequently, the quantitative correlation of these values is also directly linked to the attainment of the relevant energy efficiency improvement objectives. Apparently, the key pillar for attaining the core objective for RES is the RES share in electricity consumption, and therefore this sub-sector is the main policy priority and poses the highest demand for the timely and efficient implementation of the measures planned. Attaining this objective requires a sharp increase in RES installed capacity for power generation, which is expected to more than double the current RES installed power for most of the relevant technologies. One can easily understand that this is a very ambitious, but also realistic, objective, taking into account the existing technical and economic potential and the investment interest already expressed. However, attaining that objective requires optimal response and functioning of the public bodies involved, of the regulator and of the operators, as well as of the RES market itself. Therefore, meeting this requirement in an optimal manner in the following period is a key challenge.   57 Another objective with regard to promoting RES and increasing their share in final consumption is the electrification and coupling of final consumption sectors. On this axis, the gradual electrification of the transport sector is the major challenge in the following period. More specifically, a considerable penetration of electric vehicles is expected, making a substantial contribution to various dimensions of the NECP, whereas full electrification will be achieved in rail transport much earlier. The aim is to achieve this penetration in the most cost-effective way for the national economy, while at the same time appropriate infrastructure and the necessary regulatory framework must be developed in a timely manner as these are prerequisites for the electrification of the transport sector. A further aim is to combine consumption sectors to the greatest and most efficient extent possible, placing emphasis on maximising the use of RES. The electrification of different uses in final consumption is an essential component in achieving this aim. A typical example is heat pumps which, together with the future greater use of energy storage systems and autoproduction schemes, will make a decisive contribution in this direction. A similar example is the possibility of feeding either hydrogen or methane produced from RES into the natural gas network. In this direction, the sustainability and efficiency of such a scheme will be considered initially and, if deemed positive, appropriate measures and policies will be promoted. Moreover, an objective has been set for promoting RES systems in buildings and dispersed generation systems, through autoproduction and net metering schemes. More specifically, a forecast has been made for having such RES power generation systems in operation with an installed capacity of 1 GW, capable of covering the average electricity consumption of at least 330 000 Greek households, by 2030. As regards the evolution of RES shares in final consumption, Tables 7 and 8 show the forecast of the evolution of these shares at specific times. Table 7: Evolution of RES shares per objective and per sector by 2030. Evolution of RES shares 2020 2022 2025 2027 2030 RES share in gross final energy consumption [%] 19.7% 23.4% 27.1% 29.6% 35% RES share in final consumption for heating and cooling [%] 30.6% 33.8% 36.8% 38.3% 42.5% RES share in gross electricity consumption [%] 29.2% 38.6% 46.8% 52.9% 61% RES share in final consumption for transport [%] 6.6% 7.3% 10.1% 11.7% 19.0% 58 Table 8: Progress in respect of the share of RES by sector by 2030. Progress in respect of the share of RES energy in attaining the objective for 2030. 2022 2025 2027 2030 in gross final energy consumption 31.8% 53.6% 68.5% 100% in final consumption for heating and cooling 27.0% 52.3% 64.5% 100% in gross electricity consumption 29.6% 55.4% 74.6% 100% in final consumption for transport 5.6% 28.3% 41.3% 100% More specifically, while the evolution of RES shares in power generation and heating is relatively linear, the RES share in transport is expected to be more pronounced gradually after 2025, especially towards the end of the next decade and during the period 2028-2030, when it is expected, in economic terms, that electric vehicles will optimally penetrate the market, with RES representing the dominant share in the electricity mix compared to all other fuels, and that advanced biofuels will be used for the same reasons. It should be stressed that the roadmap proposed in the NECP, despite clearly being non-linear as explained in the previous paragraph, is perfectly compatible with the timeline foreseen for the objective concerned in the context of the Energy Governance Regulation and incorporates the flexibility required at a national energy planning level in terms of market response and in terms of the optimal implementation and performance of the policies and measures planned. This is considered to be the best possible development at a national economy level, as the scheduling of new RES projects for power generation and the coverage of thermal needs with RES systems will not lead to non-optimal financial investments and will protect the national energy system and available funding programmes from being trapped, at an early stage, in actions and measures that would be more efficient if distributed more smoothly over the period under consideration.   59 In the field of RES power generation, the dominant applications that will contribute to the attainment of the objectives in the following period are wind farms and photovoltaics, which are considered to be the most mature and competitive ones in accordance with market and cost-effectiveness rules in terms of their impact on aid issues. Tables 9 and 10 and Chart 5 show the evolution of the relevant values for RES technologies in power generation, indicating that the installed capacity of uncontrollable RES plants almost triples in the period 2017-2030. It should be noted that there is no specific timetable for offshore wind farms, but their share in the mix for attaining the power generation objective is taken for granted.

An additional objective for the following period is to gradually evaluate, also through pilot facilities and where appropriate, new applications and/or technologies for RES power generation such as:  wave energy utilisation,  hydrogen production,  combined desalination facilities,  dispersed generation systems, such as small wind turbines. Regarding the penetration and share of RES to meet thermal needs in final consumption, it is expected that there will be a significant increase in the role of heat pumps, especially in the tertiary sector, an increased share of thermal solar systems and geothermal energy, as well as a steady contribution of biomass (Table 11). Table 11: RES contribution to meet thermal needs in final consumption.

Lastly, electric vehicles are expected to make a substantial contribution towards the end of the following decade. The contribution of biofuels will remain dominant, with a particularly increasing share of advanced biofuels, during the last part of the period 2020-2030 in particular (Table 12).

The development of an integrated framework with regard to the siting of RES facilities, applicable across Greece and subject to clear-cut rules, criteria and constraints, is critical in ensuring higher RES penetration in power generation. Furthermore, the overall reform of the licensing framework is imperative in view of the new operating support scheme, the aim for the development and operation of a large number of new RES projects, as well as the possibility of direct participation in the electricity market in accordance with the requirements of the new directive. The effective coordination and cooperation between the institutional bodies involved and the development of an efficient mechanism for monitoring all operating parameters are deemed to be necessary for the effective functioning of the revised licensing framework and for monitoring the effectiveness of the existing aid scheme. In general, a substantial improvement in the implementation control and monitoring mechanism is required for numerous policy measures, and there are specific cases in which the necessary regulatory framework is yet to be completed.  62 The completion and full implementation of the new electricity market model is crucial for the effective functioning of the new plants which will be under obligation to participate in the electricity market. A critical parameter and challenge for the following period will be the fact that due account should be taken of all the specific characteristics, stochastic production from RES plants in particular, in order to adapt at a planning level, respectively, the operating parameters of the new energy markets that will allow for the optimal RES share in the new operating model of the electricity market. As regards tender procedures, the development of special and common, as well as area-specific tender procedures, is already underway, and the evaluation of the scheme used for tender procedures in 2020 is expected to give clear directions in respect of their expansion and potential further homogenisation. At the same time, a significant challenge is the definition of a temporally stable framework for conducting these tender procedures with predefined auctioned capacity values, as well as the handling of non-optimal outcomes between the tenderers and/or selected plants. The eventual objective of these tender procedures is to achieve aid values that are comparable to those of other European countries and to eventually eliminate the need for operating aid for RES plants in operation. Also, in respect of the Special RES Account, the major challenge is to maintain the investment security that results from ensuring its long-term sustainability, as well as to improve its liquidity. At a technical level, it is also critical for the following period to develop an appropriate institutional framework for storage units and have them participate in the electricity market. The participation of these units is considered to be crucial for attaining high shares of RES in the electricity market. In this context, plans have to be made immediately also for making possible the deployment of storage units within a RES plant, using simplified procedures. A similar challenge for the following period is to develop and operate new categories of RES projects with technological innovation and/or local added value for power generation. The setup and functioning of small wind turbines incorporates such potential characteristics, and delaying the completion of the regulatory framework for this category of projects also delays the essential evaluation of such systems in terms of the economy and social acceptance. Offshore wind farms are expected to pose a new challenge for the regulatory framework, as the timely and integrated development of such a framework is a necessary prerequisite for launching these projects in the following decade.   63 As regards net metering, the challenge is to gradually expand the scheme and attain higher growth rates. At the same time, however, a mechanism will have to be developed gradually for monitoring its impact on regulated charges. In addition to that, the provision of technical support is crucial in specific policy measures, such as in the case of energy communities. As regards the measures for expanding the transmission system and the distribution network in order to allow for the optimal and timely setup of new RES projects, there are various challenges which need to be addressed rather immediately, as there have been long delays caused already (also in issuing generation authorisations) in the implementation of RES plants and their integration in the energy networks. The management complexity and time lags due to external factors are the main challenges to the setup of such plants, and there is a need to address the congestion of the power grid in order to allow for setting up new RES capacity in areas with a high potential. Generally, it is necessary to put in place a more dynamic plan for integrating new RES plants in the power grids, which should incorporate the different regulatory and technical challenges and external parameters in a transparent and effective manner. As regards the non-interconnected islands, the Management Code should take into account the new requirements for RES plants that affect even their operational/financial plan and require the completion of all necessary implementation tools. A challenge  in technical and licensing-financial terms  that is expected to emerge gradually in the following period consists in the radical renewal of the equipment of end-of-lifecycle plants, although this is expected to culminate after 2030.   64 RES for heating and cooling The incomplete regulatory framework and the absence of an implementation monitoring mechanism are the main problems relating to the promotion of RES in nearly zero-energy buildings, while the need for the stakeholders to obtain education/training and to adapt to the technical requirements is also critical. In the case of geothermal energy, despite the existence of certain areas with a significant exploitable geothermal potential in Greece, the lack of information and the technical difficulties in implementing and developing the relevant district heating networks pose the major challenges to the use of geothermal energy in various areas with a significant exploitable geothermal potential in Greece. As regards exploiting these fields for power generation, there have been no developments at all either due to technical problems and defective licensing procedures or due to reactions on the part of local communities, thus depriving the electricity system of power generation plants that could function continuously and flexibly. Similar problems are detected in respect of the energy utilisation of residual biomass, where growth rates are still very low. A technical and regulatory challenge expected in the following period is the transition to a new aid scheme for producing biomethane and feeding it into the natural gas network. Emission problems (microparticles) due to open/free combustion spots and the absence of certification of the raw material used are the main obstacles to further promoting biomass for space heating, whereas corrective measures need to be adopted and regulatory tools need to be applied to mitigate the potential adverse environmental impact. In the case of existing financing mechanisms, for the use of RES in final consumption, priority is given to simplifying the relevant procedures and selecting the most cost-effective applications. Moreover, it is important to develop performance indicators for the use of specific financing mechanisms in respect of technologies and types of users. RES in transport As regards policy measures for promoting RES in transport, it should stressed initially that the electrification of the transport sector, with high shares of RES in the electric mix, will contribute automatically to a higher RES share in energy consumption, plus the benefits relating to improved energy efficiency and reduced emissions and pollutants. The most important problem of electromobility is the high initial cost of electric vehicles, which has also undermined the sustainability of the required charging infrastructures. Completing the institutional framework 65 for the operation of the electromobility market and developing the required infrastructures are an important parameter for, as well as a challenge to, the further promotion of the use of electric vehicles, along with reducing the purchasing cost of electric vehicles, which is expected to accelerate based on estimates from the global automotive industry in the period up to 2025. As regards biofuels, similarly, the main objective should be to promote the use of Greek raw materials and to support domestic biodiesel producers. However, the current regulatory framework needs to be revised to render the further exploitation of biodiesel compatible with the policy on the promotion of advanced biofuels and the reduction of conventional biofuels in line with the requirements of the new Directive. Please note that increasing the fleet of public transport vehicles of all types, as well as of the special-purpose public vehicles (municipal transport, municipal school buses, etc.) that will be powered by electricity or biofuels, aiming to reduce the use of private vehicles, will contribute both to an increase in the RES share and an improvement in energy efficiency in the transport sector. An additional challenge is to increase the use of electric micro-mobility vehicles, whether private or municipal available for rental, by utilising appropriate infrastructures and mechanisms for the use of such vehicles. Similar challenges are there with regard to vehicles used by businesses for supply and loading/unloading purposes. Important challenges include providing consumers with information on the benefits of biofuels, establishing incentives for people and businesses, completing the regulatory framework, having sustainability criteria certified by voluntary schemes, and more effectively analysing and processing the statistical data collected by the information system, taking into account the reporting requirements of the new directive.   66  Challenges to the electricity system due to high RES penetration Increasing the penetration of uncontrollable RES plants (wind farms and photovoltaics in particular) will increase the volatility and uncertainty of residual load (load less output of uncontrollable RES) and the flexibility needs of the system. The main categories of flexibility sources are dispatchable power plants, storage, interconnections and demand response. It is worth noting that the current level of RES penetration (with the gradual introduction of 5.5 GW of wind farms and photovoltaics in the interconnected system over the previous years) has been achieved without new storage facilities. To achieve high levels of penetration of uncontrollable RES plants, as set out in the NECP, in an economically rational way (sufficiently low cuts in their output), there is generally a need for energy storage. For several decades, pumped storage has been the most widespread international method for large-scale storage of electricity. Today, international developments are rapid in terms of other forms of storage, for large or small installations, especially for batteries of different kinds. The coupling of markets via interconnectors in accordance with the provisions of the new electricity market model is important for achieving high levels of penetration. There is also interest in power-to-gas (e.g. hydrogen) storage applications, in the context of which the interconnection of electricity and gas networks is also investigated. Moreover, given the international interconnections of the Greek mainland system, the investigation of the needs for storage and coverage thereof at a regional level may also prove efficient. It is also worth noting that, apart from storage requirements, the transformation of the electricity system to attain a 50% RES penetration poses other technical challenges too. For example, it is very likely that, even before these levels of energy penetration per year are attained, there may be power plants, e.g. wind farms and photovoltaics, whereupon electricity network operators should be prepared for the management of these plants.
