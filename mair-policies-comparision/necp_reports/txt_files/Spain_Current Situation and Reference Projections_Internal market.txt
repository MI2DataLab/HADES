ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  256 A.5 INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET  This dimension analyses the various components that make up the internal energy market. Interconnectivity, energy transmission infrastructure and the integration of the energy market are highlighted due to their importance.  The two markets referred to in this section are electricity and gas. The international exchanges in the electricity market take place via interconnections between countries. International exchanges of gas, on the other hand, take place via gas pipelines or using tankers that transport liquefied natural gas. These international exchanges are fundamental for progressing towards a unified European energy market.  A.5.1 Interconnectivity  A.5.1.1 Electricity system interconnectivity  Current interconnection level and main interconnections  Spain is currently electrically interconnected with the Member States Portugal and France, as well as with Andorra and Morocco, which are not part of the EU.  The main characteristics of the interconnections with the various countries mentioned are explained below:   The interconnection with France consists of five lines: Hernani-Argia 400 kV, Arkale-Argia 220 kV, Biescas-Pragnères 220 kV, Vic-Baixas 400 kV and Santa Llogaia-Baixas 400 kV.  The Santa Llogaia-Baixas line is direct current and went into operation in October 2015 through the eastern Pyrenees. It is highly important as it made it possible to double the electrical exchange capacity with this country, reaching a total of 2,200-2,800 MW. It is also important given its influence on the quality and security of the supply and on the capacity for integrating renewable energy. Despite this latest line, the need to increase for the Spanish electricity system.   The interconnection with Portugal is formed of 11 lines: Cartelle-Lindoso 400 kV 1 and 2, Conchas-Lindoso 132 kV, Aldeadavila-Lagoaça 400 kV, Aldeadavila-Pocinho 1 and 2,220 kV, Saucelle-Pocinho 220 kV, Cedillo-Falagueira 400 kV, Badajoz-Alcáçovas 66 kV, Brovales-Alqueva 400 kV, Rosal de la Frontera-V.Ficalho 15 kV and Puebla de Guzmán-Tavira 400 kV. These lines have a total exchange capacity of between 2,200 and 3,000 MW.   There are plans to increase this capacity by constructing a new 400 kV line through Galicia between Fontefría (Spain) and Vilafría (Portugal), which will allow a total exchange capacity of about 4,300 MW to be reached together with the other existing lines.   The interconnection with Andorra is via the 110-kV Adrall-Margineda line.  Finally, the interconnection with Morocco is via two underwater 400-kV lines, which in total provide an exchange capacity of about 800 MW. ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  257  Commercial exchange capacity and ratio for electricity interconnection  The total capacity for effective exchange between two countries not only depends on the nominal capacities of the cross-border lines but also the related network, the distribution of electricity flows with the other interconnections and the location of the generation centres and consumption points. For this reason, the sum of the nominal capacities of the cross-border lines may be significantly lower than the total effective capacity.  The exchange capacity values of the mainland Spanish system with France, Portugal and Morocco are shown below for the period from 2013 to 2018, according to the information provided by the system operator.  The exchange capacity values available to the system operator are considered and two values are given, one with the 70th percentile64 (in line with ENTSO-E65) and another with the maximum value (this makes it possible to see more clearly the increase in interconnection capacity in the same year in which this capacity improved).

Morocco is not considered, as it is not subject to the obligations and commitments at European level.  To calculate the Iberian Peninsula ratio, only the France-Spain border is considered.  For the purposes of calculating the numerator, the sum of the import capacities from Spain is considered for the period taken into account. The import capacity values are obtained from the hourly Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) values published on eSIOS67.                                                            64 The 70th percentile is the value normally used to determine the exchange capacity of international interconnections. This percentile is used to leave a certain safety margin. 65 ENTSO-E, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, represents 43 transmission system operators (TSOs) from 36 European countries. 66 Up to 15 June 2018 67 eSIOS is the information system of the Spanish system operator (REE). https://www.esios.ree.es/es ANNEX A.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  259 Projections of interconnector expansion requirements  The Council of Ministers Agreement of 16 Planning. Electricity Transmission Network Development Plan 2015-Desarrollo de la Red de Transporte de Energía Eléctrica 2015-2020), provided for in Article 4 of Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013 on the Electricity Sector and published by Order IET/2209/2015 of 21 October 2015. This plan replaces the part corresponding to the electricity transmission -Sectores de Electricidad y Gas 2008- May 2008.  The 2015-2020 plan includes a new 400-kV line through Galicia, called Fontefría-Vilafría, to boost the Spain-Portugal interconnection.  Likewise, to improve the Spain-France interconnection, a 550-MVA phase shifter was included on the 2015-2020 horizon, located in Arkale between the Arkale substation (Oiartzun, Gipuzkoa) and Argia (France). This is a key element for increasing the capacity for exchange with Europe and the security of supply. This system, declared a Project of Common Interest by the European Union and placed in service on 30 June 2017, involved an investment of EUR 20 m.  In addition, Annex II of the 2015-2020 planning document sets out, on a non-binding basis, the electricity transmission network infrastructure that it is considered necessary to place in service during the years following its planning horizon (after 2020). The inclusion of an installation in this Annex makes it possible to start the relevant administrative procedures for the abovementioned installations.  Since it has a longer time horizon for implementation, this Annex sets out the following interconnections with France:   underwater interconnection with France via the Bay of Biscay: Gatika-Cubnezais;  interconnection through the western Pyrenees: two alternatives, one for interconnection with France from Ichaso, the other via Navarre (Muruarte);  interconnection through the central Pyrenees via Aragon (Ejea de los Caballeros). The system operator continues to manage the projects in these three future interconnections. The consultation and public participation stage for the interconnection via the Bay of Biscay, which is the interconnection with the highest degree of progress, closed in March 2018.  Likewise, the abovementioned Annex II of the planning includes a new Spain-Andorra interconnection, via the double-circuit overhead 220 kV line between the Adrall substation and the Andorran border.  With the placing in service of the underwater interconnection with France via the Bay of Biscay, it will get a 5,000 MW interconnection with the rest of Europe. Once the trans-Pyrenean projects are placed in service, this interconnection will reach 8,000 MW. It is important to note that the European interconnection targets would still not be reached despite this significant growth in interconnection capacity.   ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  260 A.5.1.2 Gas system interconnectivity: Current interconnection level and main interconnections  Spain currently has six physical interconnections, four with EU Member States and two with third countries.  Interconnections with France There are two physical interconnections with France, via the municipalities of Irún (Gipuzkoa) and Larrau (Navarre). Both are managed as a single interconnection or virtual point (VIP Pirineos). The transmission capacities are as follows:   France-Spain direction: 165 GWh/day firm + 65 GWh/day interruptible.  Spain-France direction: 225 GWh/day. Over the course of 2017, the net importation via this interconnection was 43 TWh, which represents a daily net flow of 121 GWh/day in the North-South direction, although with marked seasonality. The usual flow is therefore France-Spain, although it may be reversed on particular occasions.  It is worth bearing in mind that the interconnection capacity of Spain, and in the Iberian Peninsula as a whole, is counted among the smallest in the EU. In 2017, the maximum demand was recorded on 5 December, with 1,772 GWh/day. For that specific day, the firm interconnection capacity with France could only contribute 9% of the demand, a percentage that would be able to reach up to 13% taking into account the interruptible capacity.  Interconnections with Portugal There are two physical interconnections with Portugal, via the municipalities of Badajoz and Tuy (Pontevedra). Like the interconnection with France, these are managed as a single interconnection or virtual point (VIP Ibérico). The transmission capacities are as follows:   Portugal-Spain direction: 80 GWh/day.  Spain-Portugal direction: 144 GWh/day. Over the course of 2017, the net exportation via this interconnection was 30 TWh, which represented a daily net flow of 82 GWh/day.  Interconnections with Algeria There are two physical interconnections with Algeria, both one-way in an import direction:   The Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline, which crosses Morocco and enters Spain via the municipality of Tarifa (Cádiz), with a transmission capacity of 444 GWh/day. Over the course of 2017, the importation via this interconnection was 86 TWh, which represented a net flow of 237 GWh/day.  The Medgaz gas pipeline, which enters Spain via the municipality of Almería, with a transmission capacity of 290 GWh/day, which could be increased by an additional 25% with investments in Algerian territory. Over the course of 2017, the importation via this interconnection was 75 TWh, which represented a net flow of 205 GWh/day.   ANNEX A.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  265 Gas pipeline network  Law 34/1998 on the hydrocarbons sector established the following definitions:   Gas pipelines for primary transmission of natural gas at high pressure: any gas pipelines with a maximum design pressure equal to or higher than 60 bar.  Gas pipelines for secondary transmission: any gas pipelines with a maximum design pressure between 60 and 16 bar.  Distribution gas pipelines: any gas pipelines with a maximum design pressure equal to or less than 16 bar and any others that, regardless of their maximum design pressure, are intended for conducting the gas to a single consumer starting from a gas pipeline in the basic network or secondary transmission pipeline.  As at the end of 2017, there were 11,369 km of primary transmission gas pipeline, 1,992 km of secondary transmission gas pipeline and 74,000 km of distribution gas pipeline, with the transmission and distribution network totalling 87,000 km. The majority of this network is newly built, as shown in the figure below.  Figure A.6. Development of the natural gas transmission and distribution network length (km)  Source: Sedigas  As regards the transmission network, during the 2017 financial year only two secondary transmission gas pipelines were put into operation:  the Yeles-Seseña gas pipeline, with a maximum working pressure of 59 bar, length of 9 km   the Villacarrillo-Villanueva del Arzobispo gas pipeline with a maximum pressure of 49.5 bar, length of 12   Lastly, the gas pipeline network has 19 compressor stations that make it possible to transport the gas fro Regasification plants At the end of 2017, the gas system had six operational regasification plants, with the following aggregate characteristics:  Regasification capacity: 1,900 GWh/day  GWh/day.

Supplies In the structure of supplies and flows of gas at entry points, the importance of LNG provision (around 40%) stands out, as well as the weight of Algeria as the main supplier country (48% in 2017). The customs records published by the tax office and analysed by the National Commission on Markets and Competition in its Monitoring Report on the Natural Gas Market in Spain (Informe de Supervisión del Mercado de Gas Natural en España) show the following facts for 2017:  the average cost of supplies was EUR 17.55/MWh, compared to EUR 15.58/TWh in 2016;  there is a high correlation between the gas supply prices and the Brent barrel price, given that the price of the majority of Spanish gas traders-term contracts, especially with Algeria, is indexed to the price of oil. This explains the price increase in 2017 compared to 2016.  Wholesale market  Defined as the market made up of the transactions carried out by traders in the Spanish gas system, as these transactions are made in regasification plants, underground storage facilities (managed as a single storage facility) or the virtual balancing point (PVB) of the gas pipeline network. The Spanish wholesale market is characterised by the following:  The prominence of the over-the-counter market, in which 97.5% of transactions were concentrated in 2017.  Less trading activity than in other Member States due to the reduced capacity for interconnection with France and, therefore, the reduction of arbitrage opportunities.  The importance of LNG transactions in regasification plant tanks, forming six additional hubs for the PVB, with the most liquidity being concentrated in the Barcelona plant. ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  268  A significant concentration of the market in a small number of companies. In 2016, the share of transactions notified to the technical system operator by the five companies with the most activity in the market was 45%. The main figures characterising the wholesale gas market in Spain are the following:  The total gas traded on the wholesale over-the-counter market in 2017 was 515 TWh, 150% of national demand, distributed over 177,000 transactions. The majority of these volumes, around 60%, are negotiated at the PVB, with the remaining 38% corresponding to regasification plant tanks and barely 2% to underground storage facilities.  For their part, the transactions made on the organised wholesale market (MIBGAS), represented a volume of 13.38 TWh, 3.8% of national demand, distributed over 67,500 transactions. For the moment, only products delivered at the PVB are traded on MIBGAS. As regards the marginal price of the wholesale market, it can be considered that its dynamics are influenced by the following prices:  The price of LNG in regasification plant tanks, including the regasification tariff. Logically, the price of LNG in the tanks depends in turn on evolution in the price of the raw material, the cost of methane tanker transport and the unloading tariff.  The price of the flexible volumes of Algerian gas transported via the Maghreb and Medgaz gas pipelines, indexed to the price of oil.  The price of the gas in the Southern France balancing area (TRS hub), including the French network output tariff and Spanish network input tariff. Therefore, the price on the wholesale market is especially sensitive to LNG price movements, as well as price developments in the main EU hubs, although this influence is dampened by the reduced interconnection capacity and high price of the French network output tariff. It is precisely the price at the TRS hub, which is equally sensitive to LNG prices and increased by the cost of tariffs, that is closest in the long term to the price on the Spanish market.  Organised wholesale market  MIBGAS, the organised gas market, began its operations on 15 December 2015; it is where spot products with delivery at the PVB are traded. There was a significant increase in the number of participants, the volume and number of offers and transactions in the period up to December 2017: ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  269 Table A.48.

This trend is especially striking in the case of the monthly product, which in the first half of 2018 exceeded the volume of gas matched in the entire 2017 financial year.  Moreover, the tracking of the gas target model metrics carried out by MIBGAS, the market operator, in its 2017 annual report, shows how these metrics are still relatively far from those kets, although they made significant progress during the 2017 financial year.  In relation to price development, the month of January 2017 shows how, under certain circumstances, the prices of the markets in southern Europe (MIBGAS and TRS) were decoupled from those of the rest of the continent, maintaining average price differentials of EUR 15/MWh with the reference hubs for more than one month. The following circumstances came together in this specific episode:  a cold spell in France and the Iberian Peninsula, with the resulting increase in the domestic gas demand;  the unavailability of nuclear power plants in France, with the resulting increase in imports of electricity from other Member States, including Spain;  an increase in the electricity demand in Spain due to the increase in exports, with combined-cycle power stations being used for the most part, increasing the gas demand for the electricity sector;  the purchase of gas by Spanish traders on the spot market, both in southern France and on the global LNG market. The graph below shows the development of gas prices.                                                              71 Agent number data as at 31.12.2016 and 31.12.2017; 30.06.2018. Other parameters included during the reference financial year ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  270 Figure A.7. Gas market price development   Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  The decoupling phenomenon took place again between October and December 2017, with notably higher prices in the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.  However, during the early months of 2018, the disconnection of MIBGAS with respect to other Community hubs as a result of the reduced physical interconnection capacity and high tariffs had positive results for the Spanish wholesale market. In effect, the tensions recorded between 28 February and 1 March on the continental markets were barely felt by MIBGAS. Specifically, the daily product price on MIBGAS reached EUR 34/MWh compared to EUR 89/MWh on NBP, EUR 76/MWh on TTF, EUR 68/MWh on PEG Nord, and EUR 62/MWh on TRS.  In any case, as can be observed throughout the historical series, the episodes in which the continent are isolated and short-lived, with a structurally higher gas price being demonstrated.  Retail  This market is defined as the set of transactions that have taken place between traders and final consumers. The main characteristics of the Spanish retail market are as follows:   a low proportion of supply points with respect to the population, with low penetration in the domestic segment due to the climate;  high business concentration, with a high market share of the incumbent operator that maintains most of the distribution network; Jan.-16  Feb.-16  Mar.-16  Apr.-16  May.-16  Jun.-16  Jul.-16  Aug.-16  Sep.-16  Oct.-16  Nov.-16  Dec.-16 Jan.-17  Feb.-17  Mar.-17  Apr. 17  May.-17  Jun.-17  Jul.-17  Aug.-17  Sep.-17  Oct.-17  Nov.-17  Dec.-17  Jan.-18  Feb.-18  Mar.-18  Apr.-18  May.-18  Jun.-18  Jul.-18  Aug.-18  Sep.-18  Oct.-18  Nov.-18  Dec.-18  ANNEX A.

The main indicators of this market in 2017 are the following:  number of customers: 7.8 million;  number of traders with sales to final customers: 71 traders, belonging to 54 holding companies.  The market shares are set out in the table below.  Table A.49. Operator shares on the retail gas market  Operator shares on the retail market Holding company Share of sales volume Gas Natural Fenosa 39.6% Endesa 16.6% Unión Fenosa Gas 8.2% Iberdrola 6.8% Cepsa 5.0% EDP 2.4% Source: National Commission on Markets and Competition  The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index72 (HHI) value is 2,034, having recorded an improvement in the last financial year.  The business concentration in the domestic/commercial segment is even more marked, as Gas Natural Fenosa has an HHI of 3,076 in terms of number of customers. Gas Natural Fenosa concentrates 54% of customers and 50% of sales share.  In contrast, there is less concentration on the industrial gas market (HHI 2,134) and the market for electricity generation (HHI 1,631).  Business concentration has been stable for the past six years, with Gas Natural Fenosa between 40% and 47%, followed by Endesa, which has been between 15% and 17%. There has been a decrease in market share of the five biggest traders, from 84% to 76% of aggregate share, as a result of the growth of small traders.   Rate of supplier change: 9.5% This has remained relatively stable since 2013.  Number of cut-offs due to non-payment: 19,000 (2.43 cut-offs for every 1,000 customers). This has dropped significantly since 2016. Two basic tariff types coexist on the retail market:   a regulated tariff for consumers connected to pressures lower than 4 bar, with annual consumption under 50,000 kWh/year: 21% of the total customers and 2% of the sales volume;  the free market: 79% of the total customers and 98% of the sales volume.                                                            72 Index used to analyse the level of concentration in a market. The higher the index level, the higher the degree of concentration. An unconcentrated market is usually considered one with values under 1,000, while 1,000 to 1,800 is considered moderately concentrated and above 1,800 is concentrated. ANNEX A.

TUR2: EUR 619.50/year for a consumer with a consumption of 9,000 kWh/year. According to the gas price comparison for a domestic consumer (in the 2,500-5,000 kWh/year band) done by the European Commission, it is confirmed that the price in Spain is the seventh highest in the EU, due to both a higher price of the raw material and the cost of the networks.

The marketing margin that may be applied to the billing for energy and/or capacity. The cost of renting the metering equipment. Electricity taxes and VAT.  Currently, the electricity tax is 5.1127% of the energy and capacity billing.  VAT is 21% of the total bill, including the equipment rental cost and electricity tax. In terms of natural gas, once every six months Spain sends Eurostat the average domestic and industrial natural gas price by consumption band. This information is obtained from the weighted national average by sales of the prices, which the natural gas traders send to MITECO.  The price is currently broken down into price with tax, price without VAT and price without tax; nevertheless, work is being done on a future breakdown into three components: energy and supply, networks and taxes, charges and fees. As an example, the average prices sent to Eurostat for the first half of 2018 (latest available) are detailed below.  Table A.50.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  274 A.5.5 Nuclear energy in Spain  A.5.5.1 Orderly and phased closure of nuclear installations  The companies that own the nuclear installations and the National Radioactive Waste Company (Empresa Nacional de Residuos Radioactivos, Enresa), the public company responsible for managing the aforementioned waste and the work of decommissioning and dismantling the reactors, have unanimously agreed on an orderly and phased schedule for the closure of the seven nuclear reactors that remain active, an agreement that has been approved by the Government.  Following the consensus reached between the different actors involved, four reactors will be closed in stages during the period of validity of this INECP. The remaining three will do so before the end of 2035.  The orderly and phased closure of nuclear installations is compatible with the full guarantee of the electricity supply, as is confirmed in the reports of Red Eléctrica de España (see Annex D.2).  It is also fully compatible with the key objective of this INECP to achieve at least 20% emission mitigation by 2030 compared to 1990. If the reactors had been shut down at the end of their 40-year design service life, all nuclear installations would have been shut down before 2030. According to the sensitivity analyses carried out with the TIMES-Sinergia model, under these circumstances it would not have been possible to achieve the above-mentioned objective of 20% emissions mitigation compared to 1990 in a cost-effective manner.  Moreover, as a result of the aforementioned agreement between the parties, there is a sufficiently wide time scale for the process to be carried out under ideal conditions, both technically and in terms of the availability of human teams. Finally, it should be pointed out that the agreed time frame will allow the existing fund for the closure and dismantling of the facilities (Enresa) to be duly capitalised.  A.5.5.2 Security of fuel supply  The INECP 2021-2030 establishes the forecasts regarding the development of the contribution of nuclear energy to the energy mix, on the basis of which the Seventh General Radioactive Waste Plan (7th GRWP) will be drawn up.  The assurance of fuel supply to nuclear power plants until their closure is guaranteed by the Euratom Treaty itself and by the European Supply Agency (ESA), which oversees all fuel assembly supply contracts established by power plant operators in the EU.  A.5.5.3 General Radioactive Waste Plan  Article 38 bis of the Law on Nuclear Energy (LEN), Law 25/1964 of 29 April 1964, (amended by the ninth final provision of Law 11/2009 of 26 October 2009), establishes that the management of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and the dismantling and decommissioning of nuclear facilities constitutes an essential public service reserved for the State, and Empresa Nacional de Residuos Radioactivos, S.A (Enresa) is entrusted with the management of this public service. Its activities and financing system are currently set out in Royal Decree 102/2014 of 21 February 2014 ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  275 for the responsible and safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.  Similarly, Law 11/ 2009 of 29 October 2009 regulating listed companies for investment in the real estate market lays down that the financing system for this public service shall be carried out by means of a system of fees payable by the producers of radioactive waste.  In the Spanish radioactive waste management system, the GRWP is the official document that considers the strategies, the necessary actions and the technical solutions to be implemented in the short, medium and long term, aimed at the appropriate management of radioactive waste, the dismantling and decommissioning of nuclear and radioactive facilities and the other activities related to the above, including the economic and financial measures required to carry them out. The 6th GRWP currently in force was approved by the Government in June 2006. Work on the 7th GRWP is well advanced. This new GRWP will include financial and strategic aspects related to the dismantling of nuclear facilities and the management of radioactive waste.  The draft 7th GRWP in the final drafting phase of the proposal to MITECO by Enresa considers the schedule for the orderly closure of the nuclear power plants currently in operation between 2025 and 2035, consistent with that defined in the INECP 2021-2030.  The draft 7th GRWP evaluates and updates all future costs of activities associated with the abovementioned strategies and in accordance with the closure schedule. In this regard, the system for the management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, including the dismantling and  Law 54/1997 of 27 November 1997 on the Electricity Sector, as amended by Law 11/2009 of 26 October 2009.  In accordance with the Law, the levy rates and tax items for determining the rate of these fees may be reviewed by the Government by means of a Royal Decree, on the basis of an updated economic and financial report on the cost of the corresponding activities. ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  276 A.5.6 Description of energy subsidies (including fossil fuels)  The Spanish coal sector has undergone in-depth restructuring in recent years within the framework established by EU legislation (Decision 2010/787/EU of 10 December 2010 on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive mines, with aid to mining undertakings to cover losses for the financial year being eliminated from 31 December 2018, as provided for in Article 3 of that Decision).  In addition, in accordance with Decision 2010/787/EU, the subsidies to the coal mining companies that are maintained in 2019 are aid to cover the exceptional costs associated with the closure of mining operations: social aid (early retirement and redundancy) and aid for environmental restoration projects. Therefore, in 2019, no subsidies for coal production are envisaged.  All energy prices in Spain are liberalised, except for certain supplies to domestic consumers where, for some products such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), a system of regulated maximum prices is maintained for both bottled and piped LPG.  a) Tax credits  Energy products in Spain are subject to VAT at a normal rate of 21% and exceptions apply to certain uses, such as in commercial aviation and international navigation. In addition, energy products sold in the country are subject to various taxes, such as mineral oil tax, the excise duty on electricity and the excise duty on coal.  Spain applies certain subsidies to the use of energy products as fuel or motor fuel. The mineral oil tax paid for the use of diesel in agriculture and livestock farming is partially refunded; the same for professional use such as the transport of goods, passengers and taxis with certain limits. Exemptions from this tax are governed by Articles 9 and 51 of Law 38/1992 of 28 December 1992 on Excise Duty. The reduced tax rates set out in Article 50 of that law also apply, and are differentiated according to use. In particular, the following reduced rates for hydrocarbon uses are envisaged:   Gas oil used as fuel in vehicles of Article 54(2) of Law 38/1992 (stationary engines, special vehicles, agricultural vehicles) and, in general, as fuel (heating): 96.71 euros per 1,000 litres;  LPG intended for uses other than fuel uses: 15 euros per tonne;  natural gas intended for uses other than fuel uses, as well as natural gas intended for use as fuel in stationary engines: 0.65 euros per gigajoule;  natural gas intended for uses for professional purposes provided that they are not used in cogeneration processes and direct or indirect electricity generation: 0.15 euros per gigajoule;  kerosene intended for uses other than fuel uses: 78.71 euros per 1000 litres;  biodiesel for use as fuel in the uses set out in Article 54(2) and, in general, as fuel, and biomethanol for use as fuel: 96.71 euros per 1000 litres;   ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  277 b) Other Energy subsidies  Note, as reflected in Table A.51:  1. the existence of an aid scheme for renewable energy, cogeneration and waste, a specific remuneration scheme that guarantees reasonable profitability in order to compete with the other technologies; 2. capacity-based mechanisms (incentive for long-term investment and incentive for environmental investment). Therefore, in accordance with the above, the following table lists all energy subsidies in force at this date, in particular fossil fuels and measures and plans for their progressive elimination.
