2.4. Internal energy market  2.4.1. Electricity interconnectivity  The MEP provides for the roll-out of around 10 GW of additional interconnections by 2030, based on the Development Plan for the electricity transmission system. Plans have been made to establish interconnections of this kind with all countries that share borders with France, resulting in interconnectivity of around 26 GW by 2030. The indicators of the urgency of action provided for in Annex 1 to the Regulation on governance of the Energy Union would be around 30% for the nominal transmission capacity in relation to installed renewable generation capacity, and between 25% and 30% for the nominal transmission capacity in relation to peak load. The transmission system operator (RTE) is also carrying out prospective studies on the establishment of interconnections as part of the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), which takes into account the TYNDP drafted by ENTSO-E and which forms a coherent set with the MEP and the provisional balance sheet in terms of factors affecting the security of the electricity supply.

It sets a target of 200,000 photovoltaic systems for self-consumption by 2023 (including 50 collective self-consumption systems).        -out of new technologies and competitiveness  -term aim of achieving carbon neutrality within the country by 2050. Carbon neutrality is an ambitious target. According to the latest studies by the IPCC, however, achieving this target as soon as possible and at global level is the only way to contain global warming at 1.5 °C.  The transition to a low-carbon economy (i.e. one which consumes small amounts of materials and energy and is highly circular and decarbonised) involves a stepping-up of energy-related research and innovation measures aimed at developing the technologies and behaviours that will promote reductions in emissions, while ensuring that France can compete on future markets for low-carbon goods and services.  Many specific research and innovation requirements have already been identified:   in energy-related sectors: decarbonisation of energy, energy efficiency, energy storage, smart management of transmission and distribution systems
