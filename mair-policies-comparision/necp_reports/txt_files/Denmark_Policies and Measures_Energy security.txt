        109  3.3 Dimension Energy security  (i) Policies and measures related to the elements set out in 2.3 On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle. The Government will adapt climate action plans, which will contribute to ensuring that national reduction targets are met. The climate actions plan will amongst other things include the following initiatives in regard to electricity and energy security:  - A unified strategy for electrification of the transport sector, industry and society in general - Investigating the potential for Denmark to prepare a common strategy with the North Sea nations for a significant expansion and exploitation of the offshore wind potential - Investigating the potential for Denmark to construct the first energy island by 2030, with a minimum of 10 GW connected  In addition, on 2 December 2019 the Government reached agreement with the Red-Green Finance Act 2020. The parties agreed, among other things, to initiate a screening of Danish waters that can identify locations suitable for future offshore wind, which also will include screening for potential locations for a so--and-GW offshore wind capacity connected. The parties further agreed to allocate funds in support of large-scale power-to-X technologies. The parties agreed to allocate 30 million DKK in 2020, 27 million DKK in 2021 and 8 million DKK in 2022. Additionally the Government will also, together with other ambitious nations, push for an expansion of sustainable energy in the EU so that the EU becomes self-reliant in terms of energy. The 2018 Energy Agreement sets out the policies and trajectories on energy security for the coming years. With the agreement, the Parliament has set the path towards a renewables share of total energy consumption of approximately 55 % in 2030. A list of initiatives from the Energy Agreement of 2018 supports this objective and seeks to ensure that Denmark has the most integrated, market-based and flexible energy system in Europe, with efficient energy utilisation across sectors and with a continued strong security of supply. The general movement of the Danish energy sectors goes towards further diversification as a result of a political ambition to increase the amount of renewables in the energy mix and the technical challenges with the fluctuation of wind and solar power. At the moment Denmark invests in a variety of energy technologies focused on increasing the variation of possibilities in production, transmission, distribution and consumption.            110  Cybersecurity The strategy for cyber and information security correlates with legislation which also pushes the energy sectors and businesses to adapt to the new cyber and information threat assessments. The legislation in connection with the strategy and the ongoing discussions and collaboration in the energy sectors between authorities, business and other relevant contributors ensure resilience towards the complexity that dominate the cyber and information security scene. Cyber and information security threats are rarely restricted to one sector only. Therefore, The Danish Energy Agency cooperates with other authorities and companies in the sector to find collective solutions to manage these threats.  Electricity supply security In spite of the fact that fluctuating renewable energy constitutes an increasingly larger share of the electricity generation in Denmark, currently close to 50 %, there have not yet been any incidents of lack of electricity supply due to electricity generation inadequacy.  Currently, the level of security of electricity supply in Denmark is very high, also compared to the rest of Europe. In 2018 electricity was available when demanded 99,996 % of the time, and the average number of outage minutes were 22 per consumer over a year. The outages have primarily been due to failures and planned outages in the distribution grid. They are rarely related to faults in the transmission grid and have never been due to lack of capacity.  Such statistics and the general state of the electricity security of supply are presented in the annual Security of electricity supply report, prepared by the Danish TSO, Energinet. Each year Energinet is required to report on the state of the security of electricity supply and on their forecasts for the security of supply level at least ten years ahead in time, analysing the generation adequacy for the eastern and western part of Denmark separately, in order to ensure a continuous monitoring of the developments of the capacity in the system. This was formalised in the amendment to the Electricity Supply Act, Act No 704, passed by Parliament on 8 June 2018 and further detailed in the Executive Order 1217 of 15 October 2018. By Act No 704 of 8 June 2018 and Executive Order 1217 of 15 October 2018 it is also determined that the Minister of Climate, Energy and Utilities shall announce a planning target for the level of electricity supply security, given in outage minutes, by January each year starting in 2020, on the basis of the Security of electricity supply report prepared by Energinet. The Danish Energy Agency is also monitoring the level of electricity security and is conducting analyses and forecasts regularly in parallel with Energinet, in order to have a good understanding of the developments and an insight into required investments in the system.  The models indicate that the eastern part of Denmark will experience some generation inadequacy, sooner than the western part of Denmark, when forecasting the decade to come. The generation inadequacy is expected to be limited to a number of outage minutes         111  rather than hours, for the average consumer, though. The level of inadequacy and the possible countermeasures are currently being investigated. The Danish electricity supply security is susceptible to electricity generation inadequacy in the surrounding countries since the interconnectivity level in Denmark is very high and since the other countries will increase the share of intermittent renewable energy sources as well. This is a risk that is also being assessed in the models forecasting the security of electricity supply. An analysis of the generation adequacy in 2050 has been carried out in 2014, which is presented in the Energy Scenarios Towards 2020, 2035 and 2050 publication made by the Danish Energy Agency. The analysis showed that given a scenario of an energy mix largely based on wind resources Denmark should be able to manage to keep up the supply security by having storages of gas to rely on when problems occur, but there are great risks of inadequacy problems when more intermittent resources are incorporated in the systems. It is therefore necessary to continuously monitor regional developments with respect to security of electricity supply.  The policies and measures aimed at increasing the interconnectivity to the neighbouring countries are presented in section 3.4. There is a great deal of cooperation between Denmark and neighbouring European countries, which will help support the electricity supply in Denmark. In regard to extending the amount of electricity generators, it was decided with the Energy Agreement of 2018 that Denmark is going to establish three additional large offshore wind farms and that renewable energy sources in general shall be subsidized by technology neutral tenders. The specific policies and measures are described in section 3.1.2. To further the integrating of electricity and other energy resources and by using data and digitalisation of the system to optimize the system the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities is developing a smart energy action plan as prescribed by the Energy Agreement of 2018.  The way that Denmark is going to support the development of a flexible and market-driven electricity system is currently being analysed. A project mandated by the Energy Agreement of 29 June 2018 - called the Market Model 3.0 - has been initiated.  The main focus of the project will be on promoting market-based solutions for the benefit of consumers, taking into account the effective integration of renewable energy and a continued high level of electricity supply security. The project includes establishing an efficient market design, localising and implementing favourable conditions for flexibility in the market and regulating the different actors and the monopolies, such that the electricity market functions in the best possible way, and in connection to the rest of Europe. This ective on electricity market design). The purpose of connecting the implementation of the Clean Energy for all Europeans to Market Model 3.0 is to ensure that implementation of the new EU market design is not detached from other initiatives and initiatives that are needed to promote a smart and flexible energy system.         112  The implementation of smart meters, which are being rolled out in all of Denmark as in the rest of the EU, is one of the means to create demand response, as more data and information can help consumers reallocate their electricity consumption more efficiently. By the end of 2020 all consumers can be settled on an hourly basis. Another way of creating demand response is via economic incentives. Therefore, the Energy Agreement from 2018 encompasses a plan to look into how a new tariff system could be structured, among other things to facilitate demand response and a more flexible energy system with efficient use of the existing infrastructure. An interdepartmental working group has been established to manage the task to analyse a model for more cost effective tariffs. The goal is to identify a model for more cost driven tariffs. Work is ongoing and the working group will be assisted in the analysis process by a group of interested parties.  In addition to end user demand response, electrification of the Danish district heating system has a large potential for energy storage in the form of diurnal heat stores already operated by combined heat and power plants in addition to an increasing number of seasonal heat storage systems being deployed. Influenced by variable tariffs, deployment of electric heat pumps and electric boilers for heat production is expected to increase the demand response of the district heating system significantly. To this end, the Energy Agreement lowered energy taxes on electricity used for heat production and included several measures supporting the deployment of heat pumps both on a household and district heating level (see section 3.2). Solutions regarding energy storage will also be promoted concretely through an Energy storage fund of 128 million DKK. In December 2019 money was granted to two Power-to-X-projects. The projects will establish big scale production and storage of green hydrogen. Both projects have an ambition to demonstrate production and consumption of green hydrogen on near market based conditions.    s, will amongst other things, include initiatives that contribute to the electricity supply security. The Danish Government aims to investigate the potential for Denmark to prepare a common strategy with the North Sea nations for a significant expansion and exploitation of the offshore wind potential and furthermore investigate the potential for Denmark to construct the first energy island by 2030, with a minimum of 10 GW connected. The heating sector As described in section 2.3, heating is not considered a critical energy service. Thus there are no targets or policies ensuring the overall security of heat supply. In relation to the termination of the subsidy for decentral combined heat and power plants, district heating systems might shut down.  The 2018 Energy Agreement includes a package of initiatives directed at the decentral level as combined heat and power plants no longer are benefiting from the subsidy. The         113  initiatives include consulting services provided by professional advisors and technology neutral tenders, both aimed at improving energy related and financial efficiency of operations. For plants terminating operations, policies are being developed to handle stranded assets in addition to a scheme for financial support for stranded customers establishing new heating solutions. In regard to supporting the green transition of the heating sector, the Energy Agreement of 2018 also includes initiatives to this end. For instance, the use of surplus heat is supported through the abolition of the PSO system, through a reduction of the tax on electricity used for heating, and through a plan to simplify the rules regarding surplus heat and allocate 133 million DKK as of 2020 for the purpose. Geothermal energy utilization is also supported by the reduction of the tax on electricity used for heating, and by a scheme set up to limit the financial risks related to the geothermal drilling which was extended to 2024 with the Energy Agreement. The natural gas sector The producer in the North Sea has announced that the main gas production facility in the North Sea  Tyra  will be shut down from November 2019 to July 2022 in order to renovate the facility. The decision has been taken due to security reasons, as the platform has sunk since the facility came on stream in 1984, and the fact that the waves are becoming higher and more powerful. During the shut-down, gas flows on shore to Denmark will be reduced to about 10 % of the gas delivered in 2018. The oil production in the southern part of the North Sea is expected to continue during the period of renovation and the associated gas production can be evacuated to the Netherlands through the NOGAT pipe line system. However, it is expected that the export to the Netherlands will not exceed 1 BCM per year. The Tyra shut-down period represents a new challenge for the Danish as well as the Swedish security of gas supply, as the gas markets will be almost fully relying on supplies from Germany and the two Danish storage facilities. Thanks to the former expansion of the transmission system in the Northern part of Germany and in the southern part of Jutland, the import capacity from Germany in combination with the storage capacity should be sufficient to ensure gas supply to the Danish and Swedish customers. However, the gas system will be significant less flexible and more vulnerable during the reconstruction of the Tyra gas facility.  The Tyra shut-down means that Denmark will not have any gas export during the shut-down period. Today, Denmark export more than 1 billion m3 of gas to Sweden. During the Tyra shut-down Denmark will serve as transit between the European and Swedish gas markets.   The effect of the refurbishment of Tyra on the energy mix is expected to be negligible, as the energy mix rather is an effect of the energy and taxation politics than an effect of the energy supply. For instance, political goals of increasing the share of biogas can decrease the demand for natural gas, while the reduced supply from Tyra probably will be substituted by German supplies. It is possible that the natural gas will increase slightly in         114  price due to extra transportation cost and competition in the gas market, which can drive down the demand, but it will most likely only have a small effect on the energy mix.  When the Tyra facility comes on stream again, Denmark will return to be a net exporter of gas. It is expected that the degree of self-sufficiency of gas will be about 160-170 % and that Denmark will continue to be self-sufficient to at least 2035. The gas can either be consumed in Denmark or exported to Sweden, Germany or the Netherland. The production from Tyra is expected to be around 8 million m3/day, that is maximum 3 billion m3/year, and the Danish and the Swedish consumption is expected to have an equivalent size after 2022.  Oil As part of The North Sea agreement from March 2017 the Parliament adopted new legislation amending the Danish Subsoil Act and the Pipeline Act to secure improved conditions for third-party access to infrastructure in the Danish North Sea. The amendment came into force in January 2018. A pool of 100 million DKK for green initiatives in relation to oil and gas extraction was established alongside the North Sea agreement. In 2019 exploration and drilling for oil, gas and shale gas on land and in coastal areas has officially ended when a bill regarding the Danish subsoils passed, entailing the discontinuation of oil and gas exploitation on land and in the coastal waters. GEUS (Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland) and the Danish Energy Agency have made an updated assessment of the oil and gas potential on land and in the inland waters. They deem that there are no potential sources of societal significance on land in Denmark. The decision means that all future exploration and extraction of oil and gas in Denmark will not be possible on land and in coastal areas.  Biomass Nearly all of the forest biomass used for production of district heating and electricity is covered by a voluntary Danish industry agreement, concluded in 2014.  The purpose of the agreement is to ensure that biomass used in Denmark fulfils internationally recognized sustainability demands. Thus, the biomass must come from forests that are operated in a sustainable way, and the use of biomass has to lead to real CO2 reductions. The sustainability of the used biomass has to be documented in annual reports verified by a third party. The agreement comprises all plants producing district heat and electricity based on wood pellets and wood chips. Only plants with a capacity above 20 MW have to provide the documentation. The agreement covers wood from forests, but not wood from other areas such as farm land, cities etc. (See section 2.1.2). Denmark will implement the sustainability criteria of the VE II. In light of this implementation, the role of the industry agreement will be considered, as well as possible new regulation covering the use of biomass in other sectors.          115  (ii) Regional cooperation in this area Denmark is promoting regional cooperation by participating in the Nordic risk preparedness cooperation group (NordBER) and by facilitation of the operational coordination between the Nordic Electricity TSOs in the Nordic Regional Security Coordinator (RSC) stationed in Denmark. The natural gas sector The Danish TSO (Energinet) and the Polish TSO (Gaz-System) have taken the final investment decision to establish the Baltic Pipe project. The project will make it possible to transport up to 10 BCM Norwegian gas to Poland from October 2022 through the Danish gas infrastructure. The project will connect the Danish and  Polish gas markets including the possibility for Denmark to import gas from Poland. With regard to the implementation of Regulation 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply, Denmark participates in the risk groups Norway, Baltic Sea and Denmark. Denmark leads the risk group and a final report has been prepared and notified to the Commission. Furthermore, Denmark will have to make agreements with Germany and Sweden in technical, legal and financial arrangements in order to ensure that gas can be supplied to solidarity protected customers in one of the Member States in case of a request. A dialog with Germany and Sweden on these arrangements is ongoing. (iii) Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Not applicable, since the objectives to diversify our energy system and become independent from energy sources from third countries has been on the agenda in Denmark since the end of the over a long period of time as a result of the energy policy and not as a result of projects needing special financing. That said fragments of the overall energy policy on the energy security dimension are financially supported. For instance the efforts of promoting energy efficiency are supported by different schemes; see section 3.2 for more information. The implementation of wind turbines and solar photovoltaics and other renewables is also subsidized to some extent; see section 3.1.2, which contributes to the energy security and independence from other energy sources. But in general the energy security that Denmark relies on is an outcome of the historic development of the energy system.
