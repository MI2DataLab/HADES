2.2. Dimension 2: Energy efficiency   i. indicative national contribution to the EU energy efficiency target, including indicative development path 2021-2030 and cumulative savings 2021-2030 pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU  Energy efficiency measures are among the best economic measures for preventing greenhouse gas emissions and are high on the agenda in Austria, as well as being a recurring theme of the exacerbate what are occasionally long amortisation periods in business. Core measures, such as the switch to e-mobility and increased renovation rates, will increase energy efficiency (by a factor of 3 for e-mobility) with no loss of prosperity.  The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED 2012/27/EU) as amended in 2018 under the Clean Energy Package provides for an EU energy efficiency target of 32.5% for 2030. As part of the Federal improving primary energy intensity by 25-30% compared to 2015. If primary energy demand exceeds 1,200 petajoules (PJ) by 2030, the excess energy will have to be covered by energy from renewable sources. As the ratio of renewable energy to consumption and the greenhouse gas emission targets are fixed, if energy consumption increases, commensurately more renewable energy will have to be used.

Austria has set itself a target of improving primary energy intensity by between 25% and 30% when compared with 2015. In absolute terms, this corresponds to primary energy consumption of 30,763/28,712 ktoe and to final energy consumption of 25,634/23,925 ktoe in 2030. This calculation was based on an annual economic growth rate of 1.5%15.                                                                           15 GDP: http://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/Economy/national_accounts/gross_domestic_product/annual_data/index.html   Energy balance: https://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/EnergyEnvironmentInnovationMobility/energy_environment/energy/energy_balances/index.html Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 85 of 268    Figure 9: cumulative savings 2021-2030 pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU in the version of Directive 2018/2002/EU  Cumulative energy savings for the period 2021-2030   Source: Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism  Kumulierte Endenergieeinsparungen in ktoe Cumulative final energy savings in ktoe  Figure 7 shows the cumulative savings from 2021 to 2030 pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU in the version of Directive 2018/2002/EU. The calculation is based on the average annual final energy consumption over the most recent three-year period prior to 1 January 2019, which amounts to 26,995 ktoe. 0.8% therefore corresponds to a value of around 216 ktoe per year. This results in a cumulative saving in the period 2021-2030 of approximately 11,878 ktoe.  At present, Article 7 is being implemented in accordance with Directive 2012/27/EU by means of a combination of strategic measures (Art. 7b) and an obligation scheme (Art. 7a). The amended Energy Efficiency Directive 2018/2002/EU will be implemented by means of strategic measures and a possible obligation scheme; the extent to which each of these contributes to the objectives will be determined in the course of the national legislative procedure.

Indicative milestones (2030, 2040 and 2050) under the long-term renovation strategy, including savings and area to be renovated  Under Article 2a(2) of the Directive on the energy performance of buildings, in its long-term renovation strategy, each Member State must set out a roadmap with measures and domestically established measurable progress indicators, with a view to the long-term 2050 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the Union by 80-95% compared to 1990, in order to ensure a highly energy efficient and decarbonised national building stock and in order to facilitate the cost-effective transformation of existing buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings. The roadmap must include indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, and specify how they contribute to   The renovation strategy will be prepared at national level and submitted to the European Commission by 10 March 2020 in accordance with Article 46(1) of the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action.  The following milestones and indicators can be found in the draft long-term renovation strategy (LTRS) which has been submitted by the federal states for consultation:  Table 9: LTRS  milestones and indicators  MW 1990 2017 2030 2040 2050 non-renewable share 140,824 TJ 102,253 TJ 80,327 TJ 65,795 TJ 51,262 TJ high-efficiency alternative energy share 87,326 TJ 122,107 TJ 139,821 TJ 153,447 TJ 167,073 TJ Total 228,151 TJ 224,360 TJ 220,148 TJ 219,241 TJ 218,335 TJ non-renewable share 61.7% 45.6% 36.5% 30.0% 23.4% high-efficiency alternative energy share 38.3% 54.4% 63.5% 70.0% 76.6% MODEL 9,691kt 6,360 kt 4,812 kt 3,807 kt 2,928 kt TARGET 9,819 kt 6,284 kt 4,582 kt 3,273 kt 1,964 kt MODEL without greengas 0% -34% -50% -61% -70% MODEL with green gas 0% -36% -53% -67% -80%  Source: OIB 2019, draft long-term renovation strategy     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 88 of 268  iii. Other national contributions (long-term, sectoral) where applicable  Under Article 4(4) [sic] of the Governance Regulation in conjunction with Article 5(6) of the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU, the gross conditioned floor area in government buildings that does not meet the minimum overall efficiency requirements, or the annual energy savings to be achieved from 2021 to 2030, must be indicated. When calculating the energy savings target, it should be borne in mind that the energy savings achieved through energy efficiency measures must correspond to a renovation rate of 3% of the gross conditioned floor area.  These values were ascertained for the 2014-2020 commitment period and should be updated for the new period 2021-2030. Current data on the gross conditioned gross floor area will not be available until 2021. Estimates of the floor area and the resulting energy savings will be prepared for the final NECP
