 -27-  2 National objectives and targets 2.1 Dimension decarbonisation 2.1.1 GHG emissions and removals 14 i. The elements set out in Article 4(1)(a) -wide target of achieving a GHG reduction of at least 40 % by 2030 compared to 1990. This target is further broken down to emission reduction in EU ETS and non-ETS sectors by 43 % and 30 %, respectively, compared to 2005. Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 established binding national targets for individual Member States for non-ETS sectors. The targets for individual Member States range from 0 to 40 % compared to 2005. The regulation sets for the Czech Republic a binding emission reduction target of 14 % compared to 2005 and a binding linear trajectory of its achievement starting on the average of its greenhouse gas emissions for 2016, 2017 and 2018 and ending in 2030. The start of the linear trajectory of a Member State is either at five-twelfths of the distance from 2019 to 2020 or in 2020, whichever results in a lower allocation for that Member State. The Regulation also sets out flexibilities that a Member State may use.  Annual emission allocations for each year between 2021 and 2030 will be set out in implementing acts in accordance with the Regulation. For the purposes of these implementing acts, the Commission will carry out a comprehensive review of the most recent national inventory data for the years 2005 and 2016 to 2018 submitted by Member States pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013. The prand sinks related to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU sets out  rules applicable to emissions and sinks from the LULUCF sector. For the periods from 2021 to 2025 and from 2026 to 2030, taking into account the flexibilities, each Member State shall ensure that its emissions from all of the land use categories do not exceed GHG sinks.  For managed forest land, a special accounting category is set on the basis of a forest reference level. By 31 December 2018, Member States should submit to the Commission their national forestry accounting plans, including these reference levels. The benchmark level for forests in this respect corresponds to 3 801.4 kt CO2 eq. (this value will still be subject to further review by the European Commission in 2020). Based on a comparison of this reference level with the LULUCF emission projection mentioned in Chapter 4.2.1, it is clear that the Czech Republic is unlikely to be able to use flexibility in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council to achieve its target for non-ETS sectors by 2030. In relation to the LULUCF sector and carbon neutrality, it should                                                            14 It is necessary to ensure consistency with long-term strategies under Article 15.  -28-  be emphasized that in the coming years the role of forestry in the Czech Republic will change in terms of CO2 sinks due to extraordinary logging related to the elimination of bark beetle calamity. For these reasons, it is likely that the category of the managed forest land will temporarily show CO2 emissions. From the perspective of the Czech Republic, it is crucial to achieve such a CO2 emissions commitment in the LULUCF sector that takes into account the current situation in forestry caused by bark beetle calamity in the last two years (2017 and 2018), especially when finalising the benchmark levels for forests, the final version of which must be submitted to the European Commission by 31 December 2019. Further information on the LULUCF sector in the Czech Republic, including information on existing and planned policies and measures, is provided in a report submitted by the Czech Republic to the European Commission in 2017 on the basis of Article 10 of Decision No 529/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. 15 In reducing greenhouse gas emissions, priority will also be given to reducing health risk emissions to the air. This includes the urgent reduction and termination of local coal furnaces and stoves in households and increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. The aim is also to reduce, as much as possible, the emissions of PAH substances created by combustion of damp wood, the limits of which are very often exceeded in the Czech Republic.  Reduction of health hazardous substances emissions will also be prioritised in the transport sector, along with greenhouse gas emissions, by decommissioning technically outdated, desolate and low-efficiency diesel and gasoline engines, where external health and property damage significantly exceed external climate damage. ii. Alternatively, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and existing long-term strategies. If it is important in terms of contributing to the overall commitment of the Union to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or, where relevant, other targets, including any sectoral and adaptation targets  In March 2017, the Government of the Czech Republic adopted the Climate Policy in the Czech Republic, which represents a long-term strategy for the transition to a low-carbon economy and the contribution of the Czech Republic to achieving the targets of the Paris Agreement. As a long-term strategy of low-emission development, in line with Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, it was sent to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 15 January 2018. It is a climate protection strategy by 2030, with a long-term outlook for the transition to a sustainable low-emission economy by 2050. It defines the main national climate protection targets and measures to ensure that the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets are met in response to the obligations under international treaties (the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement and the obligations under EU legislation).                                                              15  The measures are available at: http://mzp.cz/cz/opatreni_v_ramci_lulucf  -29-  Table 12: Main targets and long-term indicative targets of Climate Policy in the Czech Republic Target horizon Target description Main target by 2020 By 2020, reduce emissions of the Czech Republic by at least 32 Mt CO2 eq. compared to 2005 (corresponding to a reduction of 20 % compared to 2005). Main target by 2030 By 2030, reduce emissions of the Czech Republic by at least 44 Mt CO2 eq. compared to 2005 (corresponding to a reduction of 30 % compared to 2005). Indicative target by 2040 Approach the indicative level of 70 Mt CO2 eq. of emissions in 2040. Indicative target by 2050 Approach the indicative level of 39 Mt CO2 eq. of emissions in 2050 (corresponding to a reduction of 80 % compared to 1990). Source: Climate Policy in Czech Republic The Implementation of the Climate Protection Policy in the Czech Republic will be evaluated by the end of 2021 and the first update is scheduled by the end of 2023 following the review of commitments under the Paris Agreement. 2.1.2 Renewable energy (Framework target 2030) i. Elements under Article 4(2)(a)  The Czech Republic plans to achieve the RES share in gross final consumption at 22 % by 2030, which is an increase of 9 percentage points compared to the national target of 13.0 % for 2020. This share of 22 % corresponds to the requirement to express a national contribution to the achievement of a binding EU target of 32.0 % by 2030 under Article 3 of the revised Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Directive (EU) 2018/2001). By 2022, the Czech Republic commits to achieve a share of 14.62 % under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, and to achieve 16.87 % by 2025 and 18.85 % by 2027, or to identify and implement additional policies if these interim values are not achieved.

Unfortunately, the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 has introduced a number of relatively fundamental changes in the calculation of the RES share and in this methodology. At the time of the preparation of the National Plan, neither the revised EUROSTAT methodology nor the calculation file was available to be able to verify how the changes in the Directive would be reflected in the calculation; this is also very problematic with regard to the comparability of individual values between Member States. The Czech Republic therefore made all the changes so that the calculation complies as closely as possible with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.  17 The RES consumption for the calculation of the sectoral targets, which is shown below in the tables, and the RES consumption in the sector for the calculation of the overall target differ in accordance with the methodology. 18  The methodology for determining RES share in gross final consumption is not entirely trivial. Other values are used to determine the sectoral shares and the total share in some cases; for example, values including and excluding multipliers were used for transport. There are also partial modifications to avoid double counting, for example with the energy balance, and there are some differences.  -32-  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan iii.

It is problematic for the Czech Republic to meet this indicative target, partly due to the relatively high current RES share in the heating and cooling sector (almost 20 % in 2016). The above trends correspond to the average annual growth rate of RES share in the heating and cooling sector of 1.0 %. Achieving higher growth in this sector in the period until 2030 can be described as problematic, also due to the potential for further development of individual RES sources, which has been carefully analysed within the preparation of the National Plan. Higher development of non-fuel / non-combustion sources than mentioned above can no longer be foreseen, also in view of measures and policies in this area. Further development of RES through fuel / combustion sources is already associated with possible negative impacts within other areas. The values in the above tables are given in TJ, the values in ktoe are given in the analytical annexes to this document (specifically in Annex 2).                                                              21 I.e. it is the difference in the share in the heating and cooling sector in 2030 and in 2020 divided by the number of years of the reference period (10 years in this case).  -34-  Table 18 shows the expected installed capacity (electrical), which corresponds to the trajectory of the share of renewable energy sources in the above gross final consumption. However, the above capacities must be to some extent regarded as indicative. For example, in the case of biomass, co-combustion with other fuels occurs and the installed capacity is thus distributed indicatively. In the case of hydropower, the capacity of pumped-storage hydropower plants is not included. For the biodegradable part of municipal solid waste, the total installed capacity of the sources is given, where a non-renewable component of the waste is also incinerated. Below is indicative information on the division between newly installed capacity and capacity installed due to upgrading.

The division into individual sectors is problematic and cannot be done without a significant interpretation distortion. Many sources produce in cogeneration and some proportional divisions may be relatively distorting. The requirement of division by technology is not fully understandable. Division according to the main fuels mentioned above determines the application of the technology to a large extent. The Czech Republic does not consider it appropriate to anticipate the application of individual technologies for sources where there is a large number of technological options, which should be determined by market influences.   -35-  The prediction of installed capacity divided into capacity from modernisation and new capacity is relatively problematic as it anticipates the decision-making of private entities responding to specific market conditions. However, the Czech Republic also carried out some analysis with regard to setting up the support scheme for the period 20212030, among other things taking into account the incentive farms; (ii) photovoltaic power plants and biogas plants. Based on the information about the start of drawing the aid and the period of the granted aid, it is possible to obtain some information about the duration of operation of individual resources. However, it is not possible to predict whether and for how long the source will continue to be operated after the aid ends. Table 19 summarises the results of the analysis. The range is based on the assumption that 100 % of the sources will cease operation following the end of the aid and the assumption that 60 % of the sources will continue to operate the source ten years after the end of the aid (this applies to those sources except for biogas stations, where intervals were created differently). It is apparent that for wind farms, only about 32 % of the sources that were in operation in 2016 can be in operation in 2030. In the case of photovoltaic power plants, this value is 78 %. However, the table also shows the year 2035, where the dropout of sources that are currently in operation is already quite noticeable. Therefore, in order to achieve the installed capacity (see Table 18), it is necessary for these sources to be upgraded and to remain in operation, or to be compensated by new sources. Thus, the installed capacity of new sources can significantly exceed the installed capacity difference in 2030 and 2016, as this is sometimes perceived in a simplified way. Table 19: Installed capacity of existing sources without modernisation (repowering)  Capacity in 2016 (MWe) Capacity in 2030 (MWe) Capacity in 2035 (MWe) Wind power plants 282 91206 0160 Photovoltaic power plants 2 068 1 6151 887 01 226 Biogas stations 368 287-356 N/A Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade The Czech Republic considers it very important to point out the inherent uncertainties of the outlook for the RES share in gross final consumption. It is a ratio indicator, the amount of which is therefore influenced not only by the development of the numerator but also by the development of the denominator. The developments in the final consumption / gross final consumption is affected by a number of significant uncertainties, from temperature conditions to economic growth (industrial production in the given year). Chart 3 presents the basic sensitivity analysis of the dependence of the total RES share on a change in gross final consumption. This also reflects the mutual interaction between RES and energy efficiency targets. For the context of these values, it is worth mentioning that in 2016 the contribution to the total share was 0.66 % for photovoltaic energy (with installed capacity of approximately 2 GW) 0.16 % for wind energy (with installed capacity of 0.28 GW). It can be seen from the above that if we consider a possible deviation of final energy consumption (i.e. the denominator for the calculation of the RES share) of about -2.5 % to +2.5 %, which, in absolute value, is equivalent to the deviation of -25 to +25 PJ; the resulting deviation of the RES share would be -0.5 pp and +0.5 pp (compared to the reference value). The change in final energy consumption (denominator) by 5 PJ is  -36-  therefore associated with a change in the RES share of approximately 0.1 pp and this relationship is basically linear.  The Czech Republic prefers to express the target as an interval, which allows partial uncertainties to be covered. However, this approach was not considered appropriate by the European Commission, particularly due to the simplicity of assessing the contributions by individual Member States. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic considers it appropriate and important to mention this. Chart 3: Sensitivity analysis of the total RES share depending on a change in gross final consumption  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan iv. Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink Estimated trajectories for bioenergy demand, broken down by heat, electricity and transport sectors The following tables show the estimated trajectory of bioenergy consumption and the sources to cover this consumption, broken down by domestic and imported sources and broken down by the electricity, heating and cooling sectors and the transport sector. Table 20 shows the expected consumption of bioenergy, which shows that this type of energy plays an essential role in further increasing the share of RES and achieving the EU contribution to the above RES target. Table 22 provides information on expected net imports of biomass. It follows from this table that the Czech Republic does not currently expect significant systematic imports of solid biomass and that consumption until 2030 will be covered mainly by domestic sources. The Czech Republic is currently a net exporter of solid biomass; the assumption that exports will partly decline, if this occurs, depends, among other things, on market factors. Liquid biofuels, especially biodiesel, form a certain exception to the assumption of covering 0,48%0,38%0,29%0,19%0,09%0,00%-0,09%-0,19%-0,28%-0,37%-0,46%-0,60%-0,40%-0,20%0,00%0,20%0,40%0,60%-25-20-15-10-50510152025Change in total share of RES (in percentage points)Change in gross final consumption from used value (in PJ) -37-  consumption mainly by domestic sources, where this consumption will in the future be associated with higher imports from abroad, or a partial decrease in exports (but this largely depends on market factors). It is absolutely crucial to stress that these figures can only be considered as indicative, as the outlooks and assumptions are subject to a number of uncertainties. In the Czech Republic, for example, it is now very difficult to predict the availability of forest woody biomass with regard to the further course of bark beetle calamity. Agricultural biomass production is already significantly affected by climate change and its availability will depend on a number of factors, such as the course of the growing season, the implementation of the future Common Agricultural Policy objectives and increasing environmental protection requirements, in particular the protection of water and soil resources. At the same time, the achievement of the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the use of RES should not risk the occurrence of direct competition between the availability of agricultural and forest biomass for the energy sector and the fulfilment of basic production functions in agriculture. The overall layout and mix of domestic and imported resources will also be significantly influenced in the future by the availability of these sources on the market and by the economic situation of individual actors. Therefore, the expected values below will have to be continuously verified and further refined. For more detailed information on the LULUCF sector, see Chapter 4.2.1. Local furnaces in the Czech Republic currently produce 47 % of total emissions of volatile organic compounds, 41 % of total emissions of PM10 dust particles and 74 % of total emissions of PM2.5 dust particles. A significant part of these pollutants is produces due to the burning of wet wood in unsuitable furnaces. When using wood and similar fuels in households, it is necessary to ensure that this is done in suitable furnaces and that the burned wood, wood chips or wood-based fuels such as pellets, briquettes etc. are sufficiently dried. In order to fulfil the assumptions for increasing the use of wood (biomass) for heating in the household sector, intensive support will be provided in this sector to replace inappropriate furnaces.   -38-  Table 20: Expected consumption of bioenergy broken down by sectors (in TJ) Bioenergy consumption 2016 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Electricity 17 119.2 17 802.0 18 433.7 18 593.5 18 898.8 18 857.5 18 982.0 18 587.6 17 958.1 17 596.5 16 921.6 16 605.7 Biomass 7 443.9 7 899.7 8 026.5 8 085.4 8 525.0 8 532.0 8 607.8 8 607.0 8 635.3 8 639.7 8 637.2 8 988.4 Biodegradable component of MSW 354.8 432.8 991.4 1 104.8 1 241.0 1 354.4 1 354.4 1 354.4 1 354.4 1 603.8 1 603.8 1 603.8 Biogas 9 320.5 9 469.5 9 415.9 9 403.3 9 132.8 8 971.1 9 019.8 8 626.2 7 968.4 7 353.0 6 680.6 6 013.5 Heating 111 992.0 112 242.2 119 695.8 122 526.1 127 167.5 129 981.8 133 162.1 135 895.9 138 879.2 142 496.4 145 226.4 149 313.9 Biomass (excl. households) 26 631.0 27 561.3 31 284.3 31 676.4 33 614.4 33 900.9 34 836.0 35 097.3 35 220.6 35 269.5 35 318.5 36 723.2 Biomass (households) 75 454.0 74 395.0 76 198.9 78 002.8 79 806.7 81 610.6 83 414.6 85 218.5 87 022.4 88 826.3 90 630.2 92 434.1 Biodegradable component of MSW 2 418.0 2 690.9 4 701.7 5 110.2 5 600.2 6 008.7 6 008.7 6 008.7 6 008.7 6 906.5 6 906.5 6 906.5 Biogas 7 489.0 7 595.0 7 510.9 7 736.7 8 146.1 8 461.6 8 902.9 9 571.5 10 627.5 11 494.1 12 371.2 13 250.1 Transport 12 580.0 18 557.9 19 743.0 20 234.5 21 021.8 21 692.8 22 491.6 23 534.9 25 048.8 26 452.7 27 962.6 29 421.2 Bioethanol  1 998.0 2 836.5 2 842.9 2 823.8 2 802.3 2 780.0 2 756.9 2 728.7 2 700.5 2 674.5 2 653.4 2 629.8 Biodiesel 10 582.0 15 721.4 16 761.9 17 132.7 17 520.4 17 927.4 18 318.6 18 673.8 19 060.7 19 463.0 19 877.0 20 237.2 Biogas 0.0 0.0 138.2 278.0 699.0 985.4 1 416.1 2 132.4 3 287.6 4 315.2 5 432.2 6 554.2 Total 141 691.2 148 602.2 157 872.5 161 354.1 167 088.1 170 532.1 174 635.7 178 018.3 181 886.1 186 545.6 190 110.6 195 340.8 Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan    -39-  Table 21: Estimated bioenergy consumption produced from domestic sources (in TJ) Est. consumption from dom. sources 2016 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Solid biomass 127 911.0 129 377.9 131 538.7 134 293.5 139 921.6 142 398.4 144 843.0 146 801.4 148 465.3 151 381.0 153 025.8 157 431.6 Biomass from forestry, including resid. 109 052.0 107 606.9 106 760.2 108 743.9 113 486.9 115 192.6 117 436.1 119 193.5 120 857.4 122 520.0 124 164.8 128 570.6 Cellulose extracts 15 278.0 18 138.9 18 340.0 18 541.1 18 742.1 18 943.2 19 144.3 19 345.4 19 345.4 19 345.4 19 345.4 19 345.4 Renewable component of MSW 3 581.0 3 632.1 6 438.5 7 008.5 7 692.5 8 262.5 8 262.5 8 262.5 8 262.5 9 515.6 9 515.6 9 515.6 Agricultural inputs  biofuels 8 511.6 11 092.9 11 569.5 11 350.9 11 146.8 10 961.2 10 759.0 10 426.3 10 125.4 9 841.9 9 575.1 9 275.9 Bioethanol 2 869.7 3 511.5 3 493.6 3 450.2 3 404.4 3 357.8 3 310.4 3 279.5 3 248.6 3 219.9 3 196.1 3 169.8 Biodiesel 5 641.9 7 581.4 8 075.9 7 900.7 7 742.4 7 603.4 7 448.6 7 146.8 6 876.7 6 622.0 6 379.0 6 106.2 Recycled oils22 0.0 0.0 250.0 500.0 750.0 1 000.0 1 250.0 1 500.0 1 750.0 2 000.0 2 250.0 2 476.0 Biogas from anaerobic fermentation 25 161.0 25 161.3 25 161.4 25 161.6 25 161.7 25 161.9 25 877.5 26 239.5 26 823.3 27 342.5 27 907.0 28 473.9 Biogas from agricultural inputs 22 855.9 22 856.2 22 718.1 22 578.5 22 216.4 21 954.3 22 275.5 21 981.4 21 507.2 21 085.3 20 626.6 20 166.0 Biogas from waste inputs 0.0 0.0 138.2 278.0 640.2 902.5 1 297.0 1 953.0 3 011.0 3 952.2 4 975.2 6 002.8 Landfill and sludge gas 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 2 305.1 Total 161 583.6 165 632.1 168 519.5 171 306.0 176 980.2 179 521.4 182 729.5 184 967.2 187 163.9 190 565.5 192 757.9 197 657.5 Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan                                                              22  Recycled oils are already consumed in certain quantities in the Czech Republic.

By contrast, the area of permanent grasslands used for livestock grazing and hay production increased by about 140 000 ha in the same period. However, the total area of farmed agricultural land in the Czech Republic declined by more than 120 000 ha in the period 20002017 due to the occupation of the agricultural land fund. That said, soil occupation has accelerated considerably in recent years, particularly for construction and other purposes (warehouses, shopping and entertainment centres, car parks, roads, civil engineering and industrial construction, mining of raw materials, especially sandy gravel, etc.). At present, about 15 ha of agricultural land is occupied daily, and given the continuing interest in infrastructure construction and construction plots, there is no indication that this trend of declining agricultural (and in particular arable) land has declined substantially. Table 24: State of farmed agricultural land in the Czech Republic, 20002017  Source: Czech Statistical Office The current problem is also soil degradation, in particular erosion (water and wind), soil compaction, loss of humus, reduced water absorption capacity, etc. The total damage related to soil degradation is estimated at CZK 4 to 10 billion annually (loss of topsoil, reduction of yields, clogging of watercourses, damage to private and municipal property, etc.). In the Czech Republic, over 50 % of agricultural land is potentially threatened by water erosion and about 25 % by wind erosion. On some plots, farming methods to prevent soil erosion may involve, for example, the cultivation of certain crops only with the use of soil protection technologies, no cultivation of selected erosive crops, the obligation to grow multi-annual fodder crops such as clover and alfalfa or even the conversion of the respective soil blocks or their parts to permanent grassland. Another issue is also the impact of climate change, which has recently been manifested, for example, by more frequent periods of agricultural drought, which reduce the yields of some commodities, thereby increasing the necessary crop area to ensure sufficient harvest of food commodities, feeds and bedding. Part of the land (especially of permanent grassland) is cultivated under the agri-environment-climate  -43-  measures or falls within NATURA 2000, protected landscape areas, national parks or other types of specially protected areas where, due to the protection of biodiversity or other specific requirements, intensive farming is impossible and lower production is to be expected.

The Ministry of Agriculture, however, expects a revival in livestock production, in particular in the slaughter cattle sector and in the pig and poultry sectors, in line with its Strategy with a view to 2030. This development would be desirable in terms of the structural development of agriculture, positive impacts on the quality of soil, its water regime, biodiversity and ensuring cultural landscape. In terms of raw materials for energy production, this development would entail increased demands for the production of bulk plant feed and bedding, but also a partial increase in some livestock waste for subsequent use in the RES sector. Like farmyard manure, biogas plants also contribute to the return of organic matter to the soil through digestate applied to agricultural land. Therefore, it is desirable to develop the biogas plant sector, especially in regions with insufficient intensity of livestock production. Forestry The area of forest land in the Czech Republic is slowly growing, which is because the area of newly forested land which was previously not forested is larger than the area of land which is deforested for various reasons. In 2016, the area of forest land was almost 34 % of the area of the Czech Republic. The most important owner of forests in th-owned enterprise, manages an area of 1.25 million hectares, Vojenské lesy a statky manage about 123 thousand hectares, and other State-owned forests (national parks, regional forests, etc.) manage about 121 thousand hectares. Of the total area of forests, about 60 % are managed by the State, 19 % by natural persons, 17 % by municipalities, 3 % by legal persons, 2 % by the church and 1 % by cooperatives. The total timber stock was estimated at 696 million m3 in 2016. The timber stock in the Czech Republic is given without bark.

Source: Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) In 2018 a total of 25.69 million m3 of raw timber was harvested in the Czech forests, which represents an increase of 6.3 million m3 compared to the previous year. This volume was largely caused by the processing of extraordinary logging of 23.01 million m3 timber. In 2018, the share of extraordinary logging was 90 % and the default conditions for planned forest management continued to deteriorate. In terms of tree composition, the volume of coniferous logs increased by 6.47 million m3 to 24.21 million m3 in 2017. Consequently, the share of coniferous logging in total logging was approximately 94 %.  -45-  The proportions of deciduous and coniferous logging are influenced by the processing of extraordinary logging, especially the trees affected by bark beetle, and the demand on the raw timber market.  Conclusions materials used in the energy sector, is around 350400 thousand ha. Forestry produces about 2 million m3 of wood chips, 1.5 million tonnes of cellulose extracts and almost 5 million tonnes of firewood which are further used every year for energy purposes. In this respect, agricultural and forestry management plays an important role in the production of biomass further used as RES, thus contributing significantly to increasing energy self-sufficiency and meeting national climate commitments. The strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic with a view to 2030 permits an increase in the energy use of agricultural biomass by 2030 by 20 %, but only on condition of maintaining the strategic level of agricultural production for food use. The strategy thus confirms that the main role of agricultural land is to ensure sufficient food for human nutrition and livestock feed and bedding. This basic function can be affected by a number of negative factors, such as the loss of agricultural land, limits for erosive crops (e.g. maize, potatoes, beets, broad beans, soya, sunflower and sorghum) or the overall increase in instability of agricultural production caused by climate change (long-term drought, new pests, increased freezing of winter and spring crops, damage caused by torrential rain, hailstorms, etc.). Therefore, additional area of land available for an increase in the production of energy biomass may in fact be very limited. Moreover, by 2030 both the area of agricultural land (especially arable land) and the stability of production will decrease, which means that the land used to produce energy biomass will rather stagnate or grow only slightly. Another uncertainty resulting from yield fluctuations is the developments in prices of not only the targeted biomass, but also of post-harvest residues (especially grain straw). Increasing demand for livestock feed and bedding may cause a rise in prices, which will also affect those interested in its use as energy. In general, therefore, it is necessary to anticipate an increase in the price of energy biomass above the inflation rate in 20202030.  In view of the above, it would not be responsible to continue to intensively increase the use of agricultural land for energy purposes; we should rather focus on its more efficient use in terms of the unit amount of energy from RES in final consumption per hectare. This could be fostered, for example, by the development of biomethane production or the partial replacement of targeted biomass in biogas plants using biodegradable waste (BW) or biodegradable municipal waste (BMW). This could free up a certain amount of agricultural land fund for more efficient energy use methods. Regarding forest soil and wood biomass production, a significant year-on-year volatility of its availability for energy and technical use is expected in the reference period until 2030, depending on the evolution of pest spread and on the capacities for the processing of increased extraordinary logging and the processing capacity of wood in the sawmill and paper industries. In areas of high intensity of extraordinary logging, a shortage of wood biomass for energy use and rising prices for bioenergy can be expected in the coming years. Change also address potential conflicts and synergies in biomass production and energy use in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services. As part of the preparation of the National Action Plan, all proposed measures were also evaluated on the basis of the environmental and ecosystem services criterion.  -46-  Biodiversity is a prerequisite for the provision of ecosystem services and contributes significantly to the improved ability of ecosystems to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Species-rich, healthy and interconnected ecosystems can mitigate the effects of extreme weather events or natural disasters, including floods, droughts and landslides. For example, wetlands and floodplains retain flood water, trees stabilise slopes and reduce soil erosion, and coastal vegetation prevents shore erosion.  Both adaptation and mitigation measures, taking into account the long-term outlook of landscape (ecosystem) management with an emphasis on biodiversity protection and provision of key ecosystem services, incl. water retention in the landscape should include measures and cooperation in particular in the areas
