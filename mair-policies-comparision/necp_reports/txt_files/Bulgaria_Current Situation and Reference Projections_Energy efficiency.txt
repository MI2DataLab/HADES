4.3 Energy Efficiency dimension i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) Figure 42 Primary energy consumption2012 -2018, ktoe  Primary energy consumption Source: NSI data In the period 2012-2018, primary energy consumption (PEC) was uneven and reflected the impact of the global economic crisis in Bulgaria. The lower PEC level was registered in 2013 (16 564 ktoe) due to the decrease in coal consumption by 969 ktoe (a decrease of 14 % as compared to 2012), oil and petroleum products by 326 ktoe (a decrease by 9 % as compared to 2012), and nuclear power by 353 ktoe (a decrease by 9 % as compared to 2012). Exported electricity also decreased from 917 ktoe to 862 ktoe. An increase by 843 or 50.5 % as compared to 2012 ktoe was registered in RES.  With the exception of 2016, when PEC decreased due to lower coal consumption, primary energy consumption was on an upward trend, increasing to 18 450 ktoe in 2018. In 2018, PEC registered an increase by 3.2 % as compared to 2012.    197  Final energy consumption (except for 2016) followed the PEC trend, increasing by 7 % over the period 2012-2018. The lowest primary energy consumption was registered in 2013 (8 671 ktoe). The decrease is mainly due to the lower consumption of petroleum products (by 319 ktoe or 11 % compared to 2012), energy for heating (by 78 ktoe or 8 % compared to 2012) and coal and fuels manufactured from coal (by 46 ktoe or 11 % compared to 2012). In 2013, an increase by 47 ktoe (or 4 % compared to 2012) was registered in renewable energy. In 2013, the year in which the lowest primary energy consumption was registered (8 671 ktoe), final energy consumption increased continually, reaching 9 747 ktoe in 2018.  Figure 43: Final energy consumption 2012-2018, ktoe  Final energy consumption Source: NSI data  Final energy consumption by sector The distribution of final energy consumption by sector is shown in the figure below.     198  Figure 44: Final energy consumption by sector, 20122018, ktoe   Final energy consumption by sector Industry Transport Services Households Source: NSI data In 2013, primary energy consumption decreased in all sectors, except for the Industry sector, which registered a small increase by 2 %.The most significant decrease by 294 ktoe (or 10 % compared to 2012) was registered in the transport sector, followed by the households sector with 112 ktoe (5 % compared to 2012) and the services sector by 46 ktoe (4 % compared to 2012). In 2014, primary energy consumption in the transport sector began to increase while continuing to decrease in the households and services sectors, reaching its lowest levels in the period 2012-2018 of 2 165 ktoe and 991 ktoe, respectively. In the period 2012-2018, the transport sector retained its dominant share in primary energy consumption in keeping with the trend registered in 2009. With a share of more than 34 % in 2018, transport was the most energy and fuel intensive sector, with more than 94 % of the fuels used being imported.  ii. Current potential for the application of high efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling Post power plants (63 %) have electricity and heat cogeneration capacity, i.e. can operate as a combined cycle power unit, but only 814 MW of heat generation capacity conforms to the criteria for high efficiency cogeneration. According to the assessment and efficient district heating and cooling conducted in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article 14 of Directive 2012/27/EU the technical potential for high efficiency cogeneration, in light of current regulatory and market conditions, is estimated at 46 627 GWh per year.   199  The potential for new high efficiency cogeneration plants is assessed on the basis of the population without district heating and of the climatic indicators in the areas with such population. The applying of the following criteria:  population above 42 000 inhabitants and  Heat consumption exceeding 10 GWh per year The average heat load (based on the average duration of the heating season and the share of heat for heating, assumed ratio of ft=0.9) is determined taking into account the heat supplied to these settlements. The total heating load plus losses is determined by taking into account the load for household hot water and applying the expected losses of heat in transmission. The average minimum and the average outside temperatures show the peak heat load for the respective settlements. When the potential is calculated, the change in GDP and the energy intensity are taken into account. The net present value is calculated for each potential new high efficiency cogeneration facility, taking into account:  the electricity and heat required to satisfy the base heat load;  the operational hours;  the lifetime of the installation;  the fixed and variable costs;  the capital expenditure required for the construction of the facility;  the type of fuel. The technology is selected on the basis of the highest net present value and the area where it should be deployed (which is generally a condition for access to various fuels). The heat quantities from the new facilities should be connected to new local district networks. Additional high efficiency gas-fired facilities are envisaged to be built in the places with existing cogeneration facilities and the difference to peak load is to be covered by boilers. In places without existing cogeneration, gas-fired boilers will be constructed. The total potential for expanding high-efficiency electricity and heat cogeneration capacity in the district heating system by 2025 is estimated at 355 MW, of which 235 MW in new capacity and 120 MW in replacement capacity. The potential for heat generation in new cogeneration installations can be realised mainly through:  switching from separate heat generation to high efficiency cogeneration;  switching from Rankine steam cycle to combined gas and steam cycle;  waste use potential.   200  iii. Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Taking existing policy measures into account, the table below sets out gross domestic consumption projections (per type of fuel and energy), PEC projections (per type of fuel/energy/sector) and projected non-energy consumption for the period 2020-2040.

Bulgaria will make efforts to maintain a continuous downward trend in final energy intensity during the period 2020-2040, with a projected average annual decrease by 2.6 %. iv. Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU In accordance with Article 5(2) of Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Article 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU No 244/2012 supplementing Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings by establishing a comparative methodology framework for calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and building elements a report on the calculation of cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings in Bulgaria has been drawn up. The report sets out the requirements for reference buildings for different categories of existing buildings. In national law, the different types of public service buildings are classified in Regulation No 1/2003 of the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works on the nomenclature of buildings. Public service buildings are classified into nine categories:   1. buildings used for education and science;  2. buildings used in the area of public health and veterinary medicine;  3. buildings used for social service delivery;  4. buildings used for culture and the arts;  5. churches and buildings used by other religions;  6. administrative buildings, buildings used for wholesale and retail trade; public catering, services and gambling;  7. buildings used for the purposes of transport and electronic communications and sports facilities. The category of public service buildings includes administrative buildings, the buildings used by banks and non-banking institutions, office buildings to manufacturing plants, buildings serving representative functions, buildings used by the postal service, the buildings used by the central and local departments of government bodies and agencies, government buildings, congress and conference centres, court buildings and the buildings used by the prosecution service, etc.   203  In accordance with Article 4(1) of Directive 2010/31/EU Member States may differentiate between new and existing buildings and between different categories of buildings. Bulgaria has not made such a differentiation nor has it established reference buildings as required by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 244/2012 and the guidelines thereto. The reason for this is that according to national law the only differentiation between new and existing buildings is in the energy performance class of the respective categories of buildings. The criteria for establishing a reference building in each category are the type of construction used, the number of storeys in the building; the age of the building and the heating system. The approach to be used to establish reference buildings will combine the virtual model with representative parameters of existing buildings from a respective category.  Energy efficiency measures have been determined for the reference buildings. In addition, packages of measures have been proposed and a combinatory methodology based on a matrix model of the possible measures for a given reference building has been applied.   The necessary primary energy has been calculated, taking into account the implementation of measures and/or packages of measures for reference buildings. The report clearly states that the method for calculation of the energy performance of buildings applied in Bulgaria is based on a European model introduced by a dedicated national standard and supplemented by models that take into account humidity exchange due to the fact that the European model only takes into account apparent temperature, which does not allow the energy necessary for cooling the building in the case of air exchange in the area that is being cooled to be estimated. For the purpose of calculating the cost-optimal levels of the energy performance of buildings and the development of national definitions for buildings with near zero-energy consumption in Bulgaria, the technical regulations adopted in 1999 have been used as a basic standard. The results of the calculations to determine the energy needs of reference buildings are set out in an annex to the report.  The report sets out global cost calculations on the basis of a costs analysis that covers the entire life-cycle of a reference building at financial level. The input parameters used to calculate global costs and the cost items included (initial investment costs, operational costs and waste disposal costs). Cost-optimal levels have been calculated for all reference buildings established, following an approach at system level, i.e. on the basis of an analysis of the ratios of heat transfer passage through the surrounding structures and elements of the building on energy consumption.   In order to assess the reliability of key input parameters an analysis has been conducted of the sensitivity of the net present value index using the factors real interest and products and energy price escalation.   The determination of minimum requirements for the energy consumption of buildings by using summary scales with numerical values for energy consumption classes was introduced into national law in 2016 by Regulation No E-RD-04-2 of 22 January 2016 on   204  the energy consumption indicators and the energy performance of buildings. The Regulation lays down the requirements for determining and the single methodology for calculating the energy cost indicators and energy performance of buildings, the parameters of the energy consumption classes arranged on a scale for the different categories of buildings and the numerical limit values of the integrated in m2, determined on the basis of the scale of energy consumption classes for different categories of buildings
