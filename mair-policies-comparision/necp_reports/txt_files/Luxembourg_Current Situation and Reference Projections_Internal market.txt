Electricity interconnectivity Existing and expected interconnections Luxembourg currently has direct network connections to all three of its neighbouring countries:  transmission network is connected to the neighbouring German transmission network (Bauler and Trier switching stations) via two 220-kV double-circuit lines with a nominal total transmission capacity of 1,960 MW.  -kV double-circuit line, which has a nominal total transmission capacity of 720 MW.  -high voltage network, with a transmission capacity of 450 MW.  At the end of 2017, the commissioning of the phase-shifting transformer in Schifflange and the possibility for Creos to use a branch of the 220-integration into the European transmission network, which also enables a permanent connection of the Creos network to the Belgian transmission network from a technical perspective. The control of the phase-shifting transformer in Schifflange by the network operators Elia and Creos makes it possible to coordinate the flow of electricity between Belgium and Germany via the Luxembourg transmission network. The stronger connection to the Belgian supply network is already contributing in particular to greater security of supply. A transition to commercial operations under the European Market Coupling is not foreseen in the short term, but will be re-examined as part of the further development of congestion management.   Creos is currently envisaging the following cross-border network expansion and enhancement measures:  Targeted replacement of existing lines with high-temperature conductors (HTC) using existing masts  Equipping/strengthening of the 220-kV line towards Germany, with a prospective maximum increase of around 2,600 MW in nominal transmission capacity in existing corridors.  Interconnection level Three different calculations are used to determine the interconnection level. This involves relating the (n-0) interconnector capacity to the following:  peak load  total installed production capacity  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 157    total installed production capacity from renewable energy  Regardless of the specific definition of the interconnection level, however, Luxembourg exceeds the targets for 2020 and 2030 many times over. As mentioned above, this scenario does not take into account the additional peak load of around 300 MW resulting from the establishment of a large consumer. If such a lower than the values listed below.

Energy transmission infrastructure Analysis  gas Luxembourg currently has network interconnection points with all three of its neighbouring countries, which are shown in  Bras (BE) Bras (BE) Luxemburg Luxembourg Pétange (BE) Pétange (BE)  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 158   Remich (DE) Remich (DE) Esch/Alzette (FR) Esch-sur-Alzette (FR) Figure 14. The transport network consists of approximately 290 km of high-pressure pipelines and a total of 63 distribution stations (pressure control stations) to downstream networks. In recent years, there have only been minor extensions of the transport network, since the expansion of the main lines is complete and, according to Creos, only occasional densification measures are planned at distribution network level, both now and in the future. Therefore, no considerable changes to the aggregated pipeline lengths are expected in the coming years.

However, this network interconnection point only supplies a  transmission system.  The uninterruptible entry capacity at the Remich interconnection point is currently limited to 100,000 Nm³/h.  The (n-1) transmission capacity that is available on a reliable and uninterruptible basis is therefore 170,000 Nm³/h at present. According to Creos, the current peak load of the protected group of customers is around 140,000 Nm³/h. The infrastructure standard applying to Luxembourg in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 would therefore have been met. However, due to the low number of interconnection points, Luxembourg is not bound by this obligation, but should attempt to fulfil it, with it still being necessary to safeguard the gas supply of the protected customers.  On account of the decommissioning of the Twinerg power plant and the associated dramatic decrease in gas demand, Creos does not see any need to expand the capacities. Creos also assumes that no industry will move into the area that will act as a major demander of gas.  Table 18: Existing and future capacities of the network interconnection points.

Electricity and gas markets, energy prices Section 4.4 presents the annual electricity and gas consumption.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 160   For the Luxembourg electricity market, 26 suppliers are currently authorised, of which 14 were active on the market last year. On the gas market, the number of authorised distributors is 14  9 of which are active22.  The current electricity and gas prices for end consumers are presented below.  The electricity prices indicated include network costs, but not tax or duties. The projection for 2020 to 2040 is based on the Primes Reference Scenario. Primes does not draw any conclusions on the characteristics of the end consumers, such as annual consumption, voltage level, etc. The gas price in Luxembourg for an average-2013/GJ) in 2015, including taxes, duties and network costs. The energy price alone was around 55% of this amount. Luxembourg currently has no precise projections on the future development of the gas price. Assuming the development in the gas wholesale price estimated by the European Commission and a constant exposure to other price components, gas prices will increase by around 62% by 2040.
