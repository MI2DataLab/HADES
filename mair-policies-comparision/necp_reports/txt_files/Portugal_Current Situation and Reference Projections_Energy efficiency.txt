4.3. Dimension Energy efficiency  i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) Data for 2018 on Primary Energy Consumption (PEC) show a reduction of 2.8% in relation to consumption in 2017. Consumption of 22 492 ktoe was seen due to greater availability of indigenous resources, particularly hydro and wind, resulting in a reduction of natural gas and coal imports to produce electricity. Analysing the last decade, 2009-2018, PEC recorded an average annual growth rate (aagr) of -0.7%32. With regard to the consumption of primary sources of energy, oil is predominant in the energy mix in Portugal. In 2018, it represented 39% of PEC, followed by renewable energy with 26%, natural gas with 22% and coal with 12%. With the introduction of natural gas in 1997 and the increased diversification of renewable energy sources, the weighting of oil in PEC has fallen in recent years, and since 2018 it has represented less than 40% of consumption. The use of coal in Portugal varies, mainly as a result of demand in the electricity production sector, which is influenced by the greater or lesser availability of renewable resources, particularly hydro and wind, given the high weighting that these components currently have. The following figure shows the evolution in total PEC by type of source from 1990 to 2018.

Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 127   In 2018, Portugal recorded total Final Energy Consumption (FEC) of 16 470 ktoe, an increase of 1.4% over 2017. During the last decade, 2009-2018, FEC recorded aagr of -0.9%. Of note among the factors contributing to the reduction in FEC in recent years is the promotion of energy efficiency with particular focus on the industrial and domestic sectors through the implementation of more efficient solutions and the slowdown in the economy which affected consumption generally across all sectors of the economy33. With respect to final energy consumption by type of source, and as already mentioned, oil plays a key role in 25%, natural gas with 11%, heat with 7%, renewables with 11%, which included the use of firewood and plant waste, Solar Thermal, Biogas and other renewables, and other sources of energy which represented 1%. In recent years, a gradual reduction has been seen in the weighting of oil in final energy consumption, while natural gas and electricity have recorded an increase. The following figure shows the evolution in total FEC by type of source from 1990 to 2018.

This was followed by Industry (30%), Domestic (18%), Services (14%) and finally Agriculture and Fisheries (3%). The structure of consumption by sector of activity has remained largely unchanged over the last decade, with only slight oscillations being seen from year to year, as the following figure shows34.                                                                        33 Provisional data for 2018.

Portugal later adopted a more ambitious target of 25% reduction (22.5 Mtoe, excluding non-energy uses).

Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling In accordance with Article 14 of Directive 2012/27/EU of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, in December 2016, Portugal conducted an assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling, taking into account the premises set out in Annex VIII of this Regulation for a 10-year timeline after the reference year used, which in  This study analysed the main energy sources of each sector with the aim of summarising energy requirements, more specifically with regard to demand for heating and cooling and thus obtain a detailed assessment. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 130   Based on this assessment, the charts indicated in Annex VIII of the Directive were created and a critical analysis of these charts was carried out. Based on a brief description of the current cogeneration situation in Portugal, the technical potential of cogeneration and efficient heating and cooling networks was analysed. The economic potential and an estimate of evolution in this potential were also analysed. With the publication of the new Energy Efficiency Directive, Directive EU 2018/2002, work on a similar study to that mentioned above has already started. Work was based on the new provisions for energy efficiency, particularly those referring to high-efficiency cogeneration.   ii.1  Energy requirements - demand for heating and cooling Demand for heating and cooling was determined based on average values of the needs of each sector, thus defining the heat replaceable by high-efficiency cogeneration. Agriculture and Fisheries: Energy consumption for this sector is highly diverse. Consumption of diesel is predominantly for agricultural and forestry machinery and also for fisheries. Electricity plays an important role in the processing and preservation of products. The preferential areas in agricultural production with greater activity are those where the climate as well as the soils are more propitious and fishing activities are restricted to the coastal area. Industry: Industry is not considered dependent on climate variations from region to region as most energy requirements are in the manufacturing process and production itself, therefore it is important to consider the energy consumption patterns in the different sub-sectors. Unlike agriculture and fisheries, heating in industry has greater weighting than cooling. Most production processes need or produce heat, so a large amount of consumption used in producing this heat could be replaced by cogeneration. Services Sector: The Services Sector is fairly diverse and ranges from small commercial units to large shopping centres and hospitals, as well as office buildings, schools, sports facilities, hotels, etc. Services vary in size (area, number of people) and in hours of use, so there is a broad spectrum of variation making it difficult to assess thermal needs per type of sub-sector. Consumption for climate control requirements is also highly influenced by climate area and by the activity the building is intended for. Energy consumption by the sector is very varied and is normally associated with large towns and cities where there is a greater concentration of companies and services. In general, energy demand for cooling is predominant in this sector and heating needs are quite low. Residential Sector: Consumption in the residential sector in Portugal is very low when compared to consumption in other European countries, particularly with regard to consumption for heating and even for cooling. This is due to climate. However, the situation does vary from region to region. In terms of final consumption, kitchens contribute the largest parcel with around 39% of final consumption, followed by water heating with 23%. However, in the former electricity is the main source, NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 131   while water heating is principally from LPG. Lighting accounts for only a small amount of energy needs with only 4.5% of consumption and energy use for cooling is minimal. The short winters and extended warm seasons together with financial limitations also explain why there are so few houses with central heating. There is even a significant number of homes for which there are no records of any type of heating, in any of the regions. A further important aspect refers to the energy source used in heating systems, where electricity is predominant, particularly in the Lisbon region. With the exception of new high-density housing estates, or proximity to services buildings which already have cogeneration, cases which are expected to have limited expression, there is insufficient demand to justify district heating networks for the residential sector. It should be noted that there has been a sharp drop in consumption in the residential sector, at an average rate of -4.4% per year since 2009. This is due to an increase in energy efficiency brought about by multiple measures implemented and the improvement in equipment as well as higher energy prices. Improved efficiency is apparently greater in ambient heating with a reduction of 31.7% from 2000 to 2013, and a drop of around 28.8% in kitchen energy and Domestic Hot Water (DHW). However, the economic recovery, growth in housing requirements and the growth in the number of electrical appliances will drive new demand for energy in buildings. Technical potential for high-efficiency cogeneration Cogeneration units in operation in 2014 provided for 1 759 MW of installed electrical power, and 4 631 MW of thermal power, having produced a total of 7 484 GWh of electrical power and 19 249 GWh of thermal energy, thus corresponding to a T/E ratio of 2.57. Total yield is 79% and the average number 4 349 hours of power use. Applying the assumptions and associated reference values to the Directive, taking into account the fuels used by each unit and system losses with respect to location voltage, results in total savings estimated at 30 740 TJ (0,73 Mtoe) of primary energy, corresponding to savings of 33.5%. The following table shows a technical potential of cogeneration for the production of heat (estimated based on maximum replacement percentages and values for replacement heat consumption) of approximately 2.7 Mtoe of potentially usable heat. The same table also shows estimates of cooling consumption requirements for Industry, the Residential Sector and Services, resulting in 0.5 Mtoe of final energy which would correspond to between 1.1 Mtoe and 2.2 Mtoe of additional heat to feed absorption chillers, thus resulting in 3.8 to 4.9 Mtoe of thermal production from cogeneration. Assuming an average T/E ratio and an average number of hours of use seen at existing cogeneration units in 2014 (2.57 and 4 349 hours, respectively), the electrical power generated and the installed electrical power would correspond to 12 TWh (2.8 GW) just to satisfy heating requirements and 17.3 TWh to 22 TWh (4.0 GW to 5.1 GW) to meet cooling requirements. However, achieving all of this potential is unrealistic as it does not take into account the operating schemes of cogeneration units, downtime for maintenance, or basic aspects such as minimum operating power. Therefore, the technical potential will be definitely higher than achievable potential. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.

Services sub-sectors where the use of cogeneration is significant, corresponding to around 40% of electrical and thermal power consumption (excluding road fuels) in this sector. This consumption is around 1.8 Mtoe of potentially usable heat and 0.25 Mtoe of consumption for cooling, which would correspond to between 2.4 Mtoe and 2.9 Mtoe of thermal cogeneration production, or, based on the same assumptions, 11 TWh to 13 TWh of generation (29% of national consumption) and 2.4 GW to 3.0 GW of installed power. This would represent an increase of 700 MW to 1 300 MW in power in relation to current installed power of 1 759 MW. A slight decrease in this potential can be expected due to the steep fall in consumption forecast for the industry sub-sectors of Pulp and Paper (-7.3%), and the Textiles Industry (-19.4%), precisely the two sub-sectors of greater relevance in cogeneration. There will also be a decrease in consumption for climate control in the Services Sector (-10.9%), notwithstanding a slight rise in overall consumption in this sector (1.7%). Therefore, in 2025 the achievable potential will be 2.2 Mtoe to 2.7 Mtoe in thermal cogeneration, or 10 TWh to 12 TWh of electricity generation and 2.3 GW to 2.8 GW of installed electrical power. Economic potential for high-efficiency cogeneration  The following figure shows the evolution of economic potential for the period from 2008 to 2026.

Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) With respect to projections for total primary energy consumption for the 2030 horizon, it is expectable that, given the policies and measures planned for implementation in the 2020-2030 period, particularly the focus on renewable energies and the decommissioning of coal-fired plants, consumption of energy will continue on a downward trend which could lead to aagr of between -0.5% and -2.3%. As a result of the decommissioning of the two coal-fired plants, this source of energy will no longer feature in the mix of primary energy consumption, contributing significantly to a reduction in the energy bill. In 2030, renewables will have the largest weighting in the energy mix, standing at more than 40%, almost double the weighting of 2015. The weighting of natural gas will remain practically unchanged in the coming decade, and oil products will drop below 40% in the weighting.

Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, according to Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings, known as EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive), requires Member States to apply a comparative methodology to the calculation of cost-optimal performance levels for minimum energy performance requirements in buildings and components of buildings, with a view to maintaining national regulations up to date. A specific goal is for the energy performance of reference buildings in regulations is to not exceed 15% of the calculated cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements. Annex I, Delegated Regulation (EU) No 244/2012 which complements the EPBD, requires Member States to define reference buildings for single family buildings, apartment blocks and multi-family buildings, office buildings and also for other categories of non-residential buildings set out in Annex I, point 5(d) to (i) of the EPBD, for which specific energy performance requirements exist. In Portugal, regulatory requirements for the energy performance of buildings are established in several different Ministerial Implementing Orders and Official Orders associated to Decree-Law No 118/2013 of 20 August 2013 which lays down the National Building Certification System (SCE), the Energy Performance Regulations for Housing (REH) and the Energy Performance Regulations for Trade and Services Buildings (RECS). With a view to meeting EPBD requirements in relation to cost-optimal issues, a series of studies was conducted on residential buildings, offices and hotels. In general terms it was concluded that:  Cooling needs are always greater than heating needs;  Although the application of thermal insulation provides improvements in performance, it does not bring advantages to the overall cost of optimal solutions;  The cost-optimal solutions encountered have lower thermal insulation indices than those set out in legislation;  Solutions in glass with a more demanding solar factor, with exterior shading correspond to lower energy consumption; NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 135    However, the most efficient cost-optimal solution is double glazing in colourless glass with exterior shading;  Cooling needs are significantly decreased when LED lighting is used, and the respective consumption also falls;  The climate control system which has lowest energy consumption is S5 (VRV) (EV3 and EV18). The initial cost of this system is higher and although the corresponding COP and EER values are more efficient, the energy savings do not offset the investment;  Ventilation solutions without heat recovery have the lowest energy consumption. It should be noted that the reference building was chosen based on certificates analysed for hotels built before 1990. This resulted in a more compact shape with a consequent lower shape factor (envelope area/surrounding volume ratio). This aspect could explain why insulation-free solutions were cost-optimal. The finding that no cost-optimal advantages are achieved with the solution using heat recovery is due to two main factors:  Greater cooling requirements in the warm seasons;  Height of buildings causing greater losses in extraction and subsequent increase in ventilator consumption. Based on the methodology adopted, for average energy cost scenarios with a discount rate of 3% and an economic life cycle of 20 years, the overall cost for the variants selected were determined. The cost-optimal   From a comparative analysis between optimal performance levels and regulatory requirements, it was concluded that the reduction in primary energy consumption of the cost-optimal variant, in relation to the reference building is 33% to 35%. This means that a review of construction solutions and minimum requirements for major renovation work on hotels built before 1990 is advised. Space exists to increase the regulatory requirements of the National Building Certification System (SCE) for major renovation in hotels
