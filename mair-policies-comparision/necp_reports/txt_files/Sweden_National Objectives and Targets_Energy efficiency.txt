2.2 Dimension energy efficiency  2.2.1 The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4  2.2.1.1 The indicative national energy efficiency contribution to achieving the Union's energy efficiency targets of at least 32.5% in 2030 as referred to in Article 1(1) and Article 3(5) of Directive 2012/27/EU, based on either primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity. Member States shall express their contribution in terms of absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2020, and in terms of absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2030, with an indicative trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards. They shall explain their underlying methodology and the conversion factors used.  Sweden has set a target for the reduction of energy intensity in terms of energy supplied in relation to GDP. This is a cross-sectoral target to reduce energy intensity by 20% between 2008 and 2020.  Energy consumption must be 50% more efficient by 2030 than it was in 2005. This target is also expressed as energy supplied (primary energy) in relation to real GDP and is part of the Energy Agreement (see Section 1.2).  Figure 5 shows the energy intensity targets, which are a 20% reduction in 2020 and a 50% reduction in 2030. Besides the difference in base and target                                                       40 Government communication 2018/19:153 Första kontrollstationen för energiöverenskommelsen. 25 (199) years, the 20% target also includes fuels for non-energy purposes, which the 50% target does not.

As Sweden's 2030 target is an energy intensity target there is no fixed level for consumption of energy supplied (primary) and final energy to meet the target. Figure 6 shows the different energy consumption levels calculated for different assumptions about the development of GDP. Assuming the economy grows at 2% a year, the primary energy consumption on meeting the target in 2030 will be 461 TWh and the final energy consumption will be 339 TWh. These are not target levels. Energy consumption may be different if the GDP develops differently.   Figure 6.

The corresponding figures for 2030 are 516 TWh and 384 TWh without further policy measures. Besides the growth in GDP, the development of energy intensity depends on primary energy consumption which, in turn, is dependent on measures for renewable energy, energy efficiency, structural changes in the industry, the future of nuclear energy and general economic growth. See Section 2.4.4 for information about sectoral energy-efficiency strategies.  Scenarios are mainly prepared in energy terms, rather than in terms of physical units, with base year statistics from the national energy balances (official statistics). Since they are prepared both for energy supplied and for final energy consumption, conversion factors for electricity and district heating, for example, are not needed for the calculations.  2.2.1.2 The cumulative amount of end-use energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030 under point (b) of Article 7(1) on the energy saving obligations pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU. For the whole of the period 20212030, Member States must achieve a cumulative end-use energy saving equivalent to an annual saving of at least 0.8% of the annual final energy consumption in 20162018. According to Eurostat data, Sweden's average final energy consumption in 20152017 was 371 TWh; this means that the provisional total savings obligation is 163 TWh. The final energy savings obligation will be determined when the 2018 energy statistics are available.   2.2.1.3 The indicative milestones of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, the roadmap with domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and the contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU. Sweden will report its long-term renovation strategy, including indicative milestones, to the Commission by 10 March 2020. The Government has commissioned the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning and the Swedish Energy Agency to prepare proposals for Sweden's long-term renovation strategy.  2.2.1.4 The total floor area to be renovated or equivalent annual energy savings to be achieved from 2021 to 2030 27 (199) under Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU on the exemplary role of public bodies' buildings.  Sweden intends to use the alternative strategy permitted under Article 5(6) of the Energy Efficiency Directive. The cumulative energy savings obligation for 20142030 is 47.6 GWh. This is shared between the Fortifications Agency, which must save 26.7 GWh and the National Property Board of Sweden, which must save 20.9 GWh. The cumulative savings obligation for 20212030 is 28.6 GWh. This is shared between the Fortifications Agency, which must save 15.8 GWh and the National Property Board of Sweden, which must save 12.8 GWh. In its decision of 11 December 2019, the Government tasked the Fortifications Agency and the National Property Board of Sweden with taking action to achieve these energy savings.  Under Article 5(2)(a) of the Energy Efficiency Directive41 buildings officially protected as part of a designated environment, or because of their special architectural or historical merit, in so far as compliance with certain minimum energy performance requirements would unacceptably alter their character or appearance, do not count as part of the building stock. Since Sweden uses this exemption these buildings are not included in the building stock.  Under Article 5(2)(b) of the Energy Efficiency Directive buildings serving national defence purposes, apart from single living quarters or office buildings for the armed forces and other staff employed by national defence authorities, do not count as part of the building stock. Since Sweden uses   2.2.2 The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and their contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU. See point 3 of Section 2.2 i).  2.2.3 Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling. On 6 July 2017 the Government commissioned the Swedish Energy Agency                                                       41 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC. 28 (199) to prepare sectoral energy efficiency strategies with various sectors in consultation with the relevant agencies. This is a task under the Energy Agreement and will continue until 2030.  It will take the form of a discussion of suitable indicative targets and efficiency by 2030, taking account of other energy and climate policy targets. The Swedish Energy Agency has identified five sectors and has defined the following strategic areas with the relevant operators: 1. Fossil-free transport. 2. World-class production. 3. A flexible and robust energy system. 4. Future trade and consumption. 5. Resource-efficient building.  The Swedish Energy Agency intends to focus on cooperation and to proceed iteratively so that strategic areas can be added or removed during the process.  The sectoral strategies must make use of the drive and ambitions of Swedish operators. It is important that their actions and activities genuinely improve the resource-efficiency of energy consumption.  Effective, high-capacity, sustainable goods transport  a national goods transport strategy, contains five key areas for the transition to fossil-free transport. The Government has issued a number of assignments under the goods transport strategy
