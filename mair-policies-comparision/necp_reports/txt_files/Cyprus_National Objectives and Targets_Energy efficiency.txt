The figures below display the projected evolution of final energy and electricity demand according to the two scenarios (With existing measures and with PPM without interconnector, as presented in paragraph 5 (impact assessment). Policies adopted in the Scenario with PPM can help accelerate improvements in energy intensity and thus essentially stabilize total final energy demand after 2025. Electricity demand, however, is still projected to increase in absolute levels (although it declines per unit of GDP) because the further electrification of the economy, including the introduction of electric cars, counterbalances energy efficiency improvements.   Figure 2.9:  Forecast of final demand in Cyprus (ktoe)   Figure 2.10: Forecast of final electricity demand in Cyprus (million kWh) 67    Figure 2.11:  The updated outlook of primary energy demand in Cyprus combines the final energy demand projections with projections for the power generation sector which were conducted in the frame of Technical Assistance29 studies that were performed for MECI in 2019. Most of these forecasts have been performed with the OSeMOSYS energy systems model, as described in more detail in the Impact Assessment chapter.  To calculate the demand for primary energy in power generation, the efficiency parameters of the power generation system presented in Table 2.7 that are based on the technical specifications of the existing and future power plants in Cyprus, were used.

It can be concluded that the forecast for national primary energy consumption of no more than 2.4 Mtoe in 2030 is lower by about 17%, than the respective projection for primary energy consumption in 2030 that was projected in the PRIMES 2007 Reference Scenario.  The same applies for the final energy consumption, where in PRIMES 2007 EU Reference Scenario the projection was 2.3 Mtoe in 2030, whilst the respective projection in the PPM Scenario, is 2 Mtoe for 2030. It can be concluded that the forecast for national final energy consumption no more than 2 Mtoe in 2030 is lower of about 13% than respective projection for Cyprus final energy consumption in 2030 that was projected in the EU PRIMES 2007 Reference Scenario. The aforementioned assessment is in line with the methodology in the framework of the amendment of the Energy Efficiency Directive, in order to calculate the EU Energy Efficiency target of 32.5% for 2030. Therefore, using the same approach, Cyprus sets its indicative contribution to the EU 2030 energy efficiency target as:   17% reduction in primary energy consumption, compared to the respective projection for Cyprus in the 2007 in the EU PRIMES 2007 Reference Scenario and   13% reduction in final energy consumption, compared to the respective projection for Cyprus in the 2007 in the EU PRIMES 2007 Reference Scenario.                                                             30 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/trends_to_2030_update_2007 .pdf 69  Compared to the EU-wide target of 1,273 Mtoe of primary energy consumption in year 2030, Cyprus (under PPM Scenario) is expected to account for 0.21% to the EU wide target for primary energy consumption in 2030, which is higher than its current annual contribution of the EU primary energy consumption.

The list of measures in the transport sector are presented in Chapter 5 (impact assessment) and in paragraph 2.2 v below. National indicative contributions for primary energy and final energy consumption in 2020 Based on the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan of  national indicative target for energy efficiency was expressed in primary energy consumption of 2.2 Mtoe in 2020. However, based on the latest modelling results, the anticipated level of national primary energy consumption in 2020 is estimated to be about 2.5 Mtoe. More specifically, compared to the previous projections used in 4th NEEAP 2017, the latest projections of energy consumption have taken into account the following:  The updated macroeconomic forecasts of the Ministry of Finance, which were published in September 2018. According to these, a stronger economic growth is foreseen up to whereas (at 2010 prices) in 2020.  The latest developments regarding the use of natural gas for power generation plants. According to the 4th NEEAP 2017, this was expected to happen by the end of 2018, 72  whereas current government plans, supported by relevant contract preparations, show natural gas penetration happening in the last quarter of year 2021. As stated in the 4th NEEAP 2017, a major reduction in primary energy consumption will be achieved through the switch from oil to natural gas in the power generation sector, which was planned to enter into the national energy mix by the end of 2018, and thus contribute to achieving the projected indicative level of 2.2 Mtoe. However, given that the aforementioned changes and latest developments show that natural gas penetration would happen in the last quarter of year 2021, the primary energy consumption for power generation in 2020 is now projected to reach 0.94 Mtoe, compared with 0.7 Mtoe in the 4th NEEAP 2017.  This explains why the anticipated level of primary energy consumption in 2020 will increase to about 2.5 Mtoe instead of 2.2 Mtoe. It should be noted that, taking into account the measures implemented in order to reduce end-use energy consumption by 2020 and based on the latest modelling results, the national projection included in the 4th NEEAP 2017 for indicative absolute level of final energy consumption of 1.9 Mtoe in 2020, can be achieved. Methodology and conversion factors used The methodology to forecast final energy demand is based on a simplified energy model that was developed at the National Technical University of Athens and used by Cyprus University of Technology (CUT). The model calculates future annual energy consumption in each major economic sector of Cyprus (agriculture, cement industry, other industry, households, services, road passenger transport, road freight transport and air transport) as a function of future macroeconomic variables and energy prices. It also calculates fuel shares in each sector, depending on technology costs (investment, operation, maintenance and fuel costs), the penetration potential of various technologies and technical constraints for the uptake of new technologies, and allows for computing of future final energy consumption by sector and fuel. Chapter IV of the study for Energy Efficiency Potential in Cyprus31 describes the mathematical formulation for calculating aggregate energy demand by sector. Final energy demand was then converted to primary energy demand taking into account the conversion table of Annex IV of 2012/27/EE apart for electricity demand where the efficiency coefficients of Table 2.7 were used. Energy Efficiency First Principle considered in the preparation of the final NECP by giving priority to policies and measures that improve the efficiency of the energy system and by taking into account that other decarbonisation measures can be considered only after energy efficiency actions are deemed unfeasible or very costly. The PPM scenario is in line with the Energy Efficiency First Principle, for the following reasons:                                                            31 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/B5969066F97FB710C22581D80035DB7F/$fil e/Study%20results-%20Developing%20a%20national%20Energy%20Efficiency%20Strategy%2 0up%20to%202050.pdf 73   The measures of the PPM scenario are sufficient to comply with the energy efficiency obligations of the country as required in Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive; this means that the appropriate measures have been taken into account.  As a result of energy efficiency measures, the energy supply of Cyprus will be lower in comparison to that of the WEM scenario. This means that energy efficiency has indeed been given priority in comparison, for example, to stronger deployment of renewable energy.  All cost-effective policies and measures that are related to energy efficiency have been included in the PPM scenario. As is being shown in the impact assessment, all these measures have a negative or near-zero total lifetime cost and are therefore cost-effective. Further, energy efficiency measures are not recommended to be deployed because they have a very high cost per tonne of carbon abated (e.g. the renovation of very old buildings to become nearly-zero energy buildings), or are considered to be unrealistic (e.g. an increase in the number of energy renovations of buildings up to 2030, which would reach unprecedented levels of refurbishments that would require very high financial and human resources to realize).   It is particularly important to note that the PPM scenario foresees energy efficiency measures in transport (modal shift towards public and non-motorized transport and electrification of cars) which involve very significant investments, at substantial levels for the size of the Cypriot economy. This underlines how strongly the Energy Efficiency First principle has been taken into account.  Apart from the cost-effectiveness argument mentioned above, further prioritizing demand-side measures such as energy efficiency improvements, and would put Cyprus at risk of not meeting two main Energy Union objectives which are related to energy supply: the renewable energy target and the reduction in emissions of ETS sectors  which in the case of Cyprus is predominantly power generation. Therefore, measures in the electricity supply that have been foreseen in the PPM scenario are indeed those which are absolutely necessary for Cyprus to meet the above-mentioned commitments.  As a result of the above considerations, energy efficiency measures in all end uses of the Cypriot economy, as foreseen in the PPM scenario and to the extent that they will be fully deployed, can greatly improve the security of energy supply of the country.  The only further policy that is worth examining is the implementation of a green tax reform that would involve carbon pricing in non-ETS sectors of the Cypriot economy. Such a reform can indeed stimulate further improvements in energy efficiency and substitution of liquid fossil fuels by low- or zero-carbon energy forms. In September 2019 the Finance Minister announced that a green tax reform will be put in consultation in 2020 with the aim to adopting the relevant legal framework and implementing such a reform in 2021. However, considerations for the adoption of such a reform were still at an early stage by the time of finalising this report, so that it could not be considered as part will be presented in the next NECP update. Projects and Developments that could potentially increase energy consumption by 2030  The government is working towards the realization of its exploration program in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Republic of Cyprus. The below projects, in case one or both 74  are implemented, could potentially increase the primary and/or final energy consumption during the period 2020  2030:  Production from the Aphrodite Field (Information presented is according to the approved Development Plan): Cyprus expects initial natural gas production from the Aphrodite field to begin in 2025. The field is estimated to produce 10 MMscfd (million standard cubic feet per day) for 18 years. There is no information on energy needs for the construction phase (2022  2025).  Vasilikos Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Plant (Information regarding the energy needs are according to a 2013 pre-FEED study): At present, there are no sufficient quantities of natural gas to support the supply of an LNG Plant. However, exploration activities are ongoing and in case more gas discoveries are discovered, the LNG Plant may go forward. If the LNG Plant is decided to be materialised, it is not expected to commence operations before 2025. It is further expected that the LNG terminal would require a dedicated generation unit of approximately 200 MW.  As a result, it is estimated that if an LNG plant operates in Cyprus, an increase of at least 10-15% will occur in the projected national primary and final energy consumption by 2030. This will have a negative effect on achieving the national indicative targets for energy efficiency in 2030. Given the aforementioned uncertainties on its implementation and the quantities produced, currently an LNG plant cannot be incorporated in the national scenario with planned polices and measures.  Cumulative amount of energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030 under Article 7 on energy saving obligations of Directive 2012/27/EU  The cumulative target of the period 2021-2030 is estimated to be 243.04 ktoe. Given that no official data from Eurostat is available for the national final energy consumption of the year 2018, the national cumulative target of the period 2021-2030 will be recalculated and submitted to the Commission in the update of the NECP by 30 June 2023, pursuant to Article 14(1) of the Regulation. More information on data and the methodology used to calculate the target is given in paragraph 3.2.i. 2.2.2. ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and their contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU The household sector accounts for 19% of the final energy consumption, while another 13% of final energy consumption is due to commerce, hotels and services. The building stock comprises of 431,059 residential buildings and more than 30,000 non-residential buildings. Of the residential buildings almost half are single-family houses and 22% apartments. The 75  majority of dwellings (67%) are occupied by their owners and a large part (78%) is located in the coastal and low land areas. The building sector is expected to play a key part in the achievement of the national targets for 2020 covering almost 98% of the energy saving target. The potential is huge since 91% of all buildings (94% of residential buildings 83% in the service sector) were built before the introduction of mandatory energy performance requirements and 50% do not have any kind of thermal insulation.  32 udy, that could be achieved in the building sector.

This would include all different building typologies: single-family house up to multi-family blocks of flats. This housing stock that undergoes a kind of energy efficiency upgrade and improvement, after considering some market related characteristics and stakehols:  a) 4% renovation of the building stock constructed before 1970 (1.635 dwellings) b) 9% renovation of the building stock constructed during 1971-1990 (10.250 dwellings) c) 20% renovation of the building stock constructed during 1991-2007 (21.200 dwellings) d) 1% renovation of the building stock constructed from 2008 up to now (315 dwellings) However, the optimum cost-efficient distribution of interventions will result in a possible range of affected households between 43,000 and 79,000, with a most likely number in the range of around 63,000 households that could proceed to a mix of energy interventions until 2030. On an annual basis this translates to an average number of close to 5.000 households that could be energy upgraded. Around 25% of these are expected to proceed only to renovation and substitution of their lighting equipment/electronic appliances to the most energy-efficient ones and/or to the installation of solar thermal systems.  Nevertheless, with this distribution of energy efficient interventions and having a threshold for the cumulative total budget until 2030, on average around 3,700 households could be targeted annually for significant energy interventions, a figure that is also representing around 1% of the existing number of households. Considering the service sector, the total number of affected buildings is estimated to be around 10,000 until 2030, resulting to an average annual number of approximately 800 buildings for which some kind of intervention could be foreseen. Similarly, around 30-40% of this annual number is expected to proceed only to the least expensive intervention with the shortest payback period and around 400 buildings annually are considered that will implement a more comprehensive type of interventions and/or one involving higher investment cost. The Long-term Renovation Strategy (LTRS) which was initially formulated in 2014 and revised in 2017 contains existing policies and measures in the building sector, as well as projections for the building stock up to 2030. The LTRS examines how possible adjustments in regulatory measures and incentives in renovation could reduce even further energy consumption of buildings by 2030.  LTRS will be revised for a second time by April 2020, according to the requirements set by Directive 2018/844/EU, which among other things requires measurable progress indicators to be set according to the energy efficiency targets set by Directive 2012/27/EU and with a view to the long-term 2050 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The PPM, which adopts the abovementioned assumptions considering expenditure in building renovation, is expected to lead in reduction of energy consumption in the housing and tertiary sector, compared to the WEM scenario. The indicative milestones in the building 77  sector for 2030, 2040 and 2050 will not to exceed the final energy demand, as it is estimated for the sector in the PPM scenario.

Figure 2.12: Estimated building sector energy consumption comparing WEM and PPM scenarios The renovation of the existing building stock is promoted with various regulatory measures, incentives, voluntary agreements training and information activities. These are described in paragraph 1.2.ii. The list includes policies and sector implicitly, but it is expected that buildings will be largely affected by their implementation.  The planned polices and measures are described on paragraph 3.2.i. Further policies and measures might be examined in the view of achieving the carbon emission goal for 2030, and the vision for decarbonizing the building stock by 2050. The following policies and measures will be examined up to next revision of NECP:  Enhancement of the Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) in the real estate market. This will require a revision of the existing legislative framework considering the sale and rent of buildings, the connection of EPC with financial incentives, and how EPC can be connected with tax policies.  2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2039 2040 2041 2042 2043 2044 2045 2046 2047 2048 2049 2050 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 WEM Scenario PPM Scenario 78   Further engagement of local authorities in building renovation. Local authorities have a dual role in building renovation. As building permit authorities, they have a responsibility for the implementation of minimum energy performance requirements. This seems harder to be overseen in existing buildings as renovation might not be declared in the local authority by the owner or the local authority personnel lacks capacity. On the other hand, local communities are using buildings for their administrative needs that are usually of poor energy performance. It should be examined how synergies with the Convent of Mayors should be utilized, how buildings of local authority could serve as rove the implementation of minimum requirements in renovation. The implementation of the above-mentioned will depend on their technical and financial feasibility and their estimated contribution in national goals in energy and climate.  engagement will be an integrated part of forming these policies.  National objectives for buildings owned and used by central government authorities The Cabinet of Ministers by its decision on the 14th of April 2016 has established the Committee for the Improvement of the Energy Performance of Central Government Buildings. The committee consists of representatives of the MECI, the Department of Public Works, the Department of Electromechanical Services, and the Control Department of the Ministry of Transport. It is tasked with planning the implementation of energy saving measures on the basis of technical data and available financial resources, as the main task of the committee is to fulfil the obligation of article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU.  Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU that Member States should either renovate annually 3% of the total area of buildings owned and used by central government authorities or choose an alternative approach including other cost-effective energy-saving measures in selected privately-owned public buildings (including, but not limited to, deep renovations and measures to change the behaviour of users), in order to achieve by 2020 an equivalent amount of energy savings.  Since the alternative approach gives more flexibility in implementing cost-effective energy saving measures as appropriate, Cyprus has chosen this alternative approach. It has been estimated that annual energy savings of 3.31 GWh or 0.285 ktoe have to be achieved for the period 20142020. The annual obligation was calculated assuming that 3% of the public building stock will be renovated from energy class E to energy class B. The primary energy consumption before and after renovation is assumed to be the one calculated for the typical building, as this is set in the costoptimum calculation of minimum energy performance requirements (see paragraph 4.iv). A report has been submitted to European Commission which lists and quantifies the measures that will be taken.  The same approach will be followed for the period 2021  2030, though the annual energy saving obligation that has been recalculated based on the modifications of public building stock. These are: 1. Renovation to at least energy class B: 3 office buildings have undergone major renovation, while one more is expected to be completed by the year 2020. 79  2. New buildings as replacements for specific central government: 2 new office buildings have been built as replacements of existing buildings.  It has to be noted that central government authorities building stock has been reduced in comparison with the calculation done for the 2014  2020 period. This is due to the recently established National Health System which has formed the State Health Services Organization (SHSO). Hospitals, health centres and other buildings related to medical services have been transferred from the Ministry of Health to SHSO. As SHSO in an independent body, these buildings have been removed from the central government building stock. The following table shows the building stock of central government, the total floor area and the energy savings that could be achieved if 3% was renovated per year. The new annual energy saving obligation for the period 2021  2030 is 1.31 GWh or 0.11 ktoe. It has to be noted that the proposed minimum energy performance requirements will require minimum energy class B+ for major renovation of non-residential buildings. This will slightly increase the annual target.

Deep renovations: Proposal to secure funds from European Cohesion and Development Funds, for the period 2021  2027  2. Individual target measures: Measures identified as cost optimum as well as measures combined with maintenance works will be undertaken by the Department of Public Works and the Department of Electromechanical Services mainly funded by national funds.  3. Behavioural measures: The Energy Saving Officer appointed in every public building is entitled to record energy consumption and promote energy efficiency mainly with soft rationale use of energy.  More information about the measures is given in paragraph 3.2.i. Moreover, according to article 6 of Directive 2012/27/EU, the central government is obliged to buy and rent only buildings that at least comply with the minimum energy efficiency requirements. The Ministry of Finance has recently made a call to buy buildings that will substitute rented buildings currently housing central government authorities. It expected that this measure will change the situation where central government is a tenant in many buildings of poor energy performance.  2.2.3. iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling National strategy for energy efficiency in transport sector the energy efficiency in the transport sector by 2030 will be achieved by continuing the measures and policies that have already being implemented/adopted by the end of 2019 and by planning additional actions to be implemented in the immediate future. This strategy will be implemented in steps, as follows:  STEP -1 Policies and measures for the period up to 2023:  1) The Amendment of the Motor Vehicles and Road Traffic Law (Law 100(I)/2013) for revision of the vehicle taxes and annual circulation taxes, a measure that relates to the tax imposed on vehicles with a view to reducing CO2 emissions, which has been in force since 2014. The latest amendment was decided on 29 March 2019 and has revised the method of calculating the motor vehicle registration (Law 47(I)/2019).  2) Incentives for the purchase and use of low/zero emission vehicles including the old vehicle scrapping scheme and financial incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles come into force in 2020.  3) The Integrated Fleet Management System (Central Government vehicles) includes the installation of an Integrated Fleet Management System by the Department of Electrical 81  and Mechanical Services, on approximately 1.800 government owned vehicles. The  4) New bus concessions are planned to be put in force in 2020 and will further improve the public transportation system. The increase of the use of buses that have low or zero GHG emissions will be implemented by reducing the average age of the public bus fleet from 17 years which is now, to 10 years for the contract period 2020-2030. Furthermore, the new bus contracts include specific requirements for the use of electric buses and when such fuel source is available in Cyprus and the prerequisites for doing so exist.  5) The Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works has installed a telematic system that manages the bus services and records data for further optimization of the public transport system. The related website and mobile application contain a detailed map of the routes and the timetable of buses in order to facilitate passengers in real time. The maintenance for 5 years.  6) The shift of modal share from car trips to sustainable modes of transport, through the policies and measures that are included in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) and the National Transport Strategy (NTS). The Limassol SUMP was completed in June 2019 and the Larnaca SUMP is expected to be completed in March 2020. Furthermore, the remaining cities in Cyprus are planning to start preparing their own SUMPs within 2020.  7) SUMPs include costed policies and measures which scientifically prove that a specific modal shift from car trips to sustainable modes of transport can be achieved. This group of measures includes significantly improved bus services (routes, frequencies, hours of operation), upgrading of infrastructure for pedestrians/ cyclists / public transport, development, implementation of a holistic parking policy, implementation of high-quality public transport corridors and essentially a group of targeted measures that promote the use of sustainable modes of transport and discourage the use of car trips. The modal share of cars in Cyprus is currently over 90% and based on the plans and studies that have already been completed; a modal share of 75% car, 13% public transport, 12% walking/ cycling can be achieved and is set as a national target.  Based on the plans and studies (including the Limassol SUMP final report33) that have includes both capital and operational costs for the period 2020-2030. It is worth noting that part of this cost is already included in the annual budget of the relevant authorities, while some of this cost can also be sourced from European, as well as, private funding  Other measures include the financing Scheme for promoting energy audits in SMEs, which promotes energy audits in the transport sector, the obligation Scheme for imposing energy efficiency obligations to distributors of motor fuel, as well as the continuation of current fuel tax levels.                                                             33 http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/PWD/pwd.nsf/All/E6D9FA846477D5B9C225844100229DB3 ?OpenDocument 82  STEP 2 Policies and measures with effect after 2023 1) Most of the measures indicated in Step 1 will continue implementation after 2023.SUMPs will increase implementation after 2023.  2) The promotion of the purchase and use of vehicles with low or zero emission takes into consideration the harmonisation and implementation of European Directives (e.g. Cleans Vehicle Directive) for the purchase of new vehicles both for the private and public sector. Based on these parameters, the impact assessment has estimated that approximately 11% of the passenger car fleet could be electric and 9% could be hybrid until 2030.  In addition to the results of the impact assessment (Chapter 5), this action also includes further incentives for the purchase and use of low/zero emission vehicles including additional old vehicle scrapping schemes, further financial incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles and further amendment of the Motor Vehicles and Road Traffic Law (Law 100(I)/2013) for revision of the vehicle taxes and annual circulation taxes. Based on these additional measures, the target for the penetration of electric vehicles is set at 20% as a proportion of the total vehicle fleet. The emission reduction impact of this higher target is not included in the latest impact assessment and its cost is based on the current old vehicle scraping scheme/ financial incentives but proposed to be  million every year. This measure is expected to be more effective after 2025 when the market conditions are expected to be more favourable for the purchase and use of electric vehicles. 3) The promotion of the purchase and use of low/zero emission buses is based on the incorporation of the new public transport contracts terms, the Clean Vehicles Directive and the incentives for the use of low/zero emission tourist buses. Based on these parameters, the impact assessment has estimated that approximately 7% of the bus fleet could be electric until 2030. This measure is expected to be more effective after 2025 when the market conditions are expected to be more favourable for the purchase and use of electric buses.  4) Decisions on implementing additional policies and measures will be presented in the first revision of the NECP. National strategy for energy efficiency in heating and cooling sector Following Article 14 and recently revised Annex VIII of the EED, the Comprehensive Assessment (CA) of efficient heating and cooling potential shall be updated by 31 December 2020. It is anticipated that after the update of the CA, a national strategy for energy efficiency in heating and cooling will be set. It will consist of implementation steps and milestones for the shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in heating and cooling sector. This strategy will be included in the first revision of the NECP.
