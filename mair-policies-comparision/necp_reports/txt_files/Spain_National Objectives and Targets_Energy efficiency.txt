2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 51 2.2 ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIMENSION 2.2.1 National energy efficiency objective for 2030  Energy efficiency first  The important efficiency measures promoted by the Plan are expected to achieve ambitious targets both in terms of emission mitigation (one out of every three tons of CO2-equivalent will be mitigated by 2030 compared to 2017), and the penetration of renewable energy in final energy consumption. Efficiency measures are central to all sectors of the economy, particularly transport and industry. As a whole, they help to achieve the objectives in a cost-efficient manner while also contributing to the expected positive impacts on the economy and employment (see Chapter 4).  The Energy Efficiency Directive (Directives 2012/27/EU and 2018/2002/EU) establishes a common framework of measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within the European Union with the objective of ensuring the achievement of the main target of improving efficiency by 20% by 2020 and 32.5% by 2030.  Within this common regulatory framework, it is up to each Member State to set an indicative national target for energy efficiency based on primary or final energy consumption, on primary or final energy savings or on energy intensity. In line with previous plans, Spain has chosen to set the indicative target for energy efficiency by 2030 in terms of primary energy consumption.  In this way, this INECP adopts the objective approved by the European Union of improving energy efficiency by 32.5% by 2030, although with the measures put in place and in accordance with the modelling exercise carried out, it is expected to achieve an improvement of 39.5%28 in 2030. This will result in primary energy consumption (not including non-energy uses) of 98.5 Mtoe during that year (see Figure 2.8).  Figure 2.8), as a result of the measures provided for in this Plan, an improvement of 39.5% in efficiency is expected with respect to the PRIMES reference scenario.   In view of the target set for 2030, Spain reviewed and updated its energy efficiency improvement objective for 2020 with respect to the objective in the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency 2017-2020.  In that Plan, the objective for 2020 meant that primary energy consumption should not exceed 122.6 Mtoe. This involved a 24.7% improvement in energy efficiency. In line with this INECP 2021-2030, the 2020 target is now defined as an improvement of 24.2%, which means not exceeding 123.4 Mtoe in terms of primary energy consumption (excluding non-energy uses).                                                            28 consumption in 2030. 2.

Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  Spain has already embarked on the path towards decarbonisation and intends to adopt regulatory and fiscal measures in order to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon economy. The collaboration of all the territorial administrations will allow progress in this energy transition process, in which the autonomous communities and the local authorities will play a fundamental role. The model of distribution of competences in Spain, where the General State Administration, the autonomous communities and the local authorities share competences in different areas requires coordination, particularly in certain areas of paramount importance such as urban planning and mobility, in order to transform our cities.  In this regard, this INECP is committed to a modal shift: the reduction of traffic, the use of public transport, sustainable mobility and electrification in terms of energy consumption in the transport sector. It also supports the energy upgrading of the existing building stock; accordingly, cities and their municipal governments must be important active agents of change.  The reduction in primary energy consumption proposed in this INECP is equivalent to 1.9% every year since 2017, which when linked to an expected increase in GDP in the same period of around 1.7% will result in an improvement in the primary energy intensity of the economy of 3.5% per year until 2030. This improvement in primary intensity is the result not only of the series of energy efficiency measures in energy end-use (see Chapter 3), but also of energy efficiency improvements in the energy-using products themselves, in energy transmission and distribution, as well as greater penetration of renewable energy in electricity generation fleet.  As a result of the policies and measures in this Plan, the final energy consumption (excluding non-energy uses) will be reduced at a year-on-year rate of 1.1% between 2017 and 2030, up to 73.6 Mtoe. 2.

Reduction objective for the consumption of primary energy in Spain excluding non-energy uses (Mtoe/year)   Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  2.2.2 Cumulative final energy saving target for 2030  The Energy Efficiency Directive requires Member States to demonstrate the achievement of a cumulative end-use energy savings target in the period: firstly, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020, and secondly, between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2030.  This cumulative end-use energy savings target has been calculated pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU. For the first period, it amounts to 15,979 ktoe, which is equivalent to 571 ktoe/year of new and additional savings of final energy, assuming that a linear distribution of the objective will be applied throughout that period. In addition, the cumulative end-use energy savings target for the second period amounts to 36,809 ktoe, which is equivalent to the achievement of new and additional savings of 669 ktoe/year every year from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030.  The cumulative end-use energy savings target in this Plan is equivalent to 36,809 ktoe, calculated from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030. This cumulative end-use energy savings target means that new and additional savings of 669 ktoe/year will be achieved, as a result of the application of the provisions of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive  savings equivalent to 0.8 % of the average annual final energy consumption over the most recent three-year period prior to 1 January 2019. Details of the calculation of annual savings are provided in Annex F.  The main difference between the calculation of the target for the first and the second period is the fact that 0.8% must be applied to the total final energy consumption without excluding the consumption of the transport sector and without the possibility of applying the flexibility mechanisms previously provided for in the first period. As a consequence of the modification of 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 54 the mechanism for calculating the target in the second period, the Energy Efficiency Directive has increased the level of ambition for Spain by 57%29 in the period 2021-2030, compared to the cumulative savings under the previous Directive.

The update carried out by the 2017 ERESEE had a qualitative approach, focusing on the analysis of the impact of measures already adopted to boost energy efficiency in buildings.                                                             29 The increase in the level of ambition of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive has been especially relevant for those countries where the transport sector accounts for a larger share of final energy consumption. 30 https://www.fomento.gob.es/recursos_mfom/pdf/39711141-E3BB-49C4-A759- 4F5C6B987766/130069/2014_article4_es_spain.pdf. 31 https://www.fomento.gob.es/recursos_mfom/pdf/24003A4D-449E-4B93-8CA5- 7217CFC61802/143398/20170524REVISIONESTRATEGIA.pdf. Cumulative total 2021-2030: 36,809 ktoe 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 55 In May 2018, Directive 2018/844/EU substantially amended Directives 2010/31/EU and 2012/27/EU, introducing a new Article 2a in Directive 2010/31/EU on the long-term strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private. A new goal has been established to make the building stock highly energy efficient and decarbonised before 2050 in order to facilitate the cost-effective transformation of existing buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings. These goals of decarbonising the housing stock by 2050 are adopted in this INECP. Further detail on milestones, indicators and intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040 will be included in EERESEE 2020, which will be presented, as established in the Energy Efficiency Directive, by 10 March 2020.  The objectives for the energy upgrading of buildings to 2030 are summarised in this Plan in Measures 2.6 and 2.8, which are explained in Section 3.2.1. in Chapter of this Plan.   Targets for the energy upgrading of buildings  Energy efficiency improvement (thermal envelope) throughout the decade for a total of 1,200,000 homes  Energy efficiency improvement (renovation of thermal heating and DHW installations) of 300,000 homes/year  2.2.4 Energy efficiency target in public buildings  Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive establishes that Member States shall establish and make publicly available an energy inventory32 of heated and/or cooled buildings owned by the General State Administration. On the basis of this inventory, Member States must renovate 3% of the building floor area each year, so that these buildings meet at least the minimum energy performance requirements set in application of Article 4 of the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings (Directive 2010/31/EU as amended by Directive 2018/844/EU).  According to the inventory, which was updated and published in December 2018, the renovation target for 2019 was 279,902 m². Energy renovations carried out between 2014 and 2018 covered a floor area of 1,457,075 m², which represents a compliance level of 100% with the renovation target set for that period. The target for renovating the building stock of the General State Administration required by the Energy Efficiency Directive is estimated at a total of 2,220,000 m2 for the period covered by this INECP. This estimate does not only take into account the inventoried area, but also the progress of the energy renovations carried out up to 2018 and the consequent reduction of the inefficient area of the General State Administration.  However, to ensure the level of ambition consistent with a decarbonised model in 2050, this Plan evaluates and promotes the savings that could be obtained by renovating 300,000 m2/year in the General State Administration. The target of renovating 3% per year is also transposed to the other territorial Administrations.                                                             32 https://energia.gob.es/desarrollo/EficienciaEnergetica/directiva2012/Inventario2018/Inventario-2018-articulo- 5.pdf 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 56  Energy efficiency targets for public buildings  Energy renovation of the public building stock of the General State Administration above the 3% target derived from Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (300,000 m2/year)  Energy renovation of 3% of the air-conditioned building floor area of the autonomous and local administrations.  The savings achieved as a result of raising the level of ambition in Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (which does not require public bodies at regional and local level to achieve a specific percentage of annual renovation, or to prepare an inventory of public buildings) will allow the cumulative final energy saving target derived from Article 7 to be met. This was calculated to be 36,809 ktoe for the whole period (669 ktoe/year, assuming that the effort is spread evenly throughout the whole period).
