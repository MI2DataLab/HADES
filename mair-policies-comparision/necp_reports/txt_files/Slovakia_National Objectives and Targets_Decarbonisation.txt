 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 2.1. Dimension: decarbonisation 2.1.1. GHG emissions and removal i. The elements set out in Article 4(1)(a)  Binding targets at EU level resulting from EU legislation:  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions: 40% in 2030 and 80-85% in 2050 compared to 1990;  Reduce CO2 emissions in the EU ETS: 43% in 2030 and 90% in 2050 compared to 2005, but this results from the EU ETS carbon trajectory as a result of EU ETS market regulations, including the market stabilization reserve, as adopted;  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS: 30% in 2030 compared to 2005, with country-specific obligations;  RES share: 32% of gross final energy consumption in 2030;  Energy efficiency: reduce primary energy by 32.5% in 2030 compared to the 2007 baseline. The revised EU ETS Directive sets a target for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in EU ETS sectors by 43% in 2030 compared to 2005. This represents an average annual reduction of 2.2% over the 2021-2030 period.  Greenhouse gas emissions from sectors outside the EU ETS are covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR). The ESR covers emissions from all sectors outside the EU ETS , except for emissions from international maritime transport, domestic and international aviation (incorporated into the EU ETS from 1 January 2012) and emissions and capture under land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). This includes a wide range of small pollution sources in a wide range of sectors: transport (cars and lorries), buildings (mainly in connection with heating), services, small industrial installations, fugitive emissions from the energy sector, fluorinated gas emissions from equipment and other sources, agriculture and waste. These sources make up about 55% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions.11 The ESR target has been subdivided into national targets that have to be met by Member States individually. Under the Effort Sharing Regulation, national emissions targets for 2030 are set as a percentage change from 2005. For the Slovak Republic this is a 12% reduction compared to 2005. The maximum greenhouse gas emissions for non-EU ETS sectors for each year from 2021 to 2030 is expressed in the quantity of annual emission allowances (AEA) allocated to each Member State for the year in question. The Environmental Strategy 2030 strategic document set a more ambitious national target for Slovakia in sectors outside the EU ETS, namely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2030 compared with 2005. Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU, was adopted in 2018. This Regulation establishes the obligations of the Member States concerning the LULUCF sector, through which contributions are made to meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the EUs greenhouse gases emissions reduction plan for the 2021-2030 period. This Regulation also lays down                                                  11 European Commission.

Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable to the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available. Addressing climate change as a global as well as a national problem requires the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. Preventing or at least minimising the risks and negative impacts of climate change can be achieved by combining measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with measures that reduce vulnerability and to increase the adaptive capacity of natural and man-made systems against the actual or anticipated negative impacts of climate change. The first more comprehensive document to provide basic strategic guidance for Slovakias adaptation to climate change and to give examples of proactive adaptation measures was the Slovak Republics Strategy for Adaptation to the Adverse Effects of Climate Change (NAS) from 2014. In 2018, the national adaptation strategy was updated, taking into account the latest scientific knowledge in the field of climate change. The updated Strategy for Adaptation to the Adverse Effects of Climate Change was approved on 17 October 2018 by Resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic No 478/2018. The strategy assesses the current state of adaptation and planned activities in key areas and sectors, defines a general vision for the adaptation of selected areas and sectors, a set of adaptation measures, and a framework for their implementation. It examines the consequences of climate change and proposes adaptation measures in multiple sectors. It proposes priority actions, an institutional framework for the coordination and implementation of adaptation activities, as well as a proposal for monitoring and evaluation, and identifies potential sources of funding. The main objectives of the updated National Adaptation Strategy are to improve Slovakias preparedness to face the adverse impacts of climate change, to provide the widest possible information on current adaptation processes in Slovakia, and to establish an institutional framework and coordination mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of adaptation measures at all levels and in all areas, as well as increase the general level of awareness about this issue.  The fulfilment of the following partial objectives should contribute towards the achievement of the main adaptation objectives: ensuring active development of the national adaptation policy, implementing adaptation measures and monitoring their effectiveness, strengthening the projection of objectives and adaptation strategy recommendations as part of multilevel public governance and entrepreneurship support, improving public awareness of the climate change issue, promoting synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures, use of the ecosystem approach in implementing adaptation measures, and supporting the reflection of objectives and recommendations of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Based on the latest scientific knowledge, the National Adaptation Strategy combines scenarios and the possible impacts of climate change over the widest possible range of sectors with proposals for appropriate adaptation measures. Achieving these goals requires effective implementation and monitoring of the adaptation measures, the promotion of synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures, as well as raising public awareness and building a knowledge base. The updated NAS applies the proactive principle of adaptation and seeks to link scenarios and the possible consequences of climate change to the widest possible range of areas and sectors with proposals for appropriate adaptation measures, is aimed at assessing the current state of adaptation and planned activities in key areas and sectors, defining a general vision of adaptation in selected areas, and updating the set of adaptation measures and frameworks to implement them. In implementing adaptation measures, the NAS supports the use of an ecosystem approach and proposes a set of adaptation measures in the following areas: mining and geology, soil environment, natural environment and biodiversity, the water regime within the country and water management, the residential environment, population health, agriculture, forestry, transport, energy, industry and some other areas of business, recreation and tourism. Adaptation measures will be further assessed and prioritised in the national adaptation Action Plan, currently in preparation. It is being prepared under the auspices of the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the Prognostic Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. Adaptation measures will be prioritized in the Action Plan based on qualitative and quantitative analyses. This prioritization will be based on the results of a participatory process involving all the relevant actors. Short-term measures for the 2020-2022 period and medium-term measures for the 2022-2025 period will be identified. The Action Plan should contribute towards better reflection of the adaptation measures in the sectoral policies of the relevant ministries. It should also include a proposal for a mid-term evaluation system for the adaptation process in Slovakia, including cost-benefit monitoring and a proposal for a platform for publishing and sharing positive experiences. Circular economy The linear economy model produces significant greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from energy-intensive production processes, but also at the end of product life cycles. A circular economy (CE) seeks to minimize and optimize energy materials and flows. The following sectors have the greatest potential for GHG reductions:  Materials (especially plastics, but also metals and cement)  Agriculture and food production (reducing losses and recycling nutrients)   Construction (material replacement, modular design, intelligent crushers, space sharing, extended lifespans)  The waste management sector  The automotive industry (vehicle sharing, durability, extended lifespans) Around 80% of Europes greenhouse gas emissions come from energy generation and use, while efforts to mitigate climate change tend to focus on improving energy efficiency and moving towards low-carbon energy sources. Circular economy measures such as optimizing the use of resources, optimizing the use of products and increasing the number of material cycles can also lead to energy savings (indirect) and thus reduce emissions.  The circular economy affects all aspects of resource use, from product design, resource extraction and production to distribution, use and disposal. Too often, the CE is only seen as improving waste management and increasing recycling rates, yet the circular economy concept goes far beyond this.  The circular economy affects not only the use of material resources, but also the use of energy resources. Our economy is largely dependent on the energy system, as it consumes electricity and fuels during the production and use of materials and products. The transition to a regenerative economy therefore also includes a transition to a system based on renewable energy sources (RES).  Climate change mitigation and circular economy measures overlap. However, circular economy measures can reduce greenhouse gas emissions other than through measures focusing on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. For example, reducing the amount of raw materials needed to produce a product indirectly reduces emissions from production by reducing the demand for raw materials.  Our increasing prosperity has led to a continuing increase in consumption, resulting in increased pressure on the environment. This translates into air, water and soil pollution, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and degradation of natural capital and biodiversity. Much of the potential of the circular economy lies in the consumption phase. There is considerable potential in changing consumer behaviour and the way products are used.  It is important to note that the production of materials and products is responsible for a significant part of our total energy consumption. Therefore, measures aimed at optimizing these production processes to minimize the demand for energy and materials can also have a major impact on greenhouse gas emissions.  Measure 3.1. of the Economic Policy Strategy 2030 imposes Adopt a document for the implementation of the circular economy in the Slovak Republic and its subsequent implementation with the aim of developing a green economy based on mutually supporting economic, environmental and energy policy aspects, promoting innovation and reducing the energy, material and emission intensity of the Slovak economy.   2.1.2. Renewable energy  i. The elements set out in Article 4(2)(a) The European Unions binding target for the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption is at least 32% by 2030. In order to achieve this binding target, Member States contributions for 2030 to this target from 2021 are in line with the indicative trajectory of this contribution. The directional trajectory reaches a reference point of at least a) 18% by 2022 b) 43% by 2025 c) 65% by 2027  of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member States binding 2020 national target and its contribution to the 2030 target. The Slovak Republic proposes a target of 19.2% in 2030, which is an increase of 5.2 percentage points compared to the target set for 2020. Based on the requirements in Article 4(2) of the Regulation, the reference points in the indicative trajectory for 2022, 2025 and 2027 are set at 14.94%, 16.24% and 17.38% for the 19.2% target. The total investment costs to achieve the RES targets are estimated at EUR 4.3 billion. These investment costs include the electricity and heating sectors. They are based on the estimated increase in installed capacity for generating electricity and heat from RES and the investment intensity per unit of output. ii. Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector By 2030, the indicative trajectory will reach at least the Member States planned contribution. The indicative trajectory for Slovakia starts at 14% in 2020.

Estimated trajectories of bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink The main sources of fuel wood biomass are forest land, long-term non-managed agricultural land with forest growth and residues from wood processing in the wood-processing, furniture and pulp and paper industry.  The area of forest land increased between 2000 and 2017 to 2.019 million ha12. Standing volume over 7 cm thick without bark increased from 410.0 to 480.3 million m3,13 while the annual increase in volume of this dimension grew from 11.2 to 12.0 million m3. Actual annual felling ranged from 6.2 to 9.8 million m3. The share of calamity felling in total felling accounted for 35% to 65%. Carbon stocks in living above-ground tree biomass rose from 166.3 to 187.6 million tonnes and in living underground biomass from 36.1 to 40.5 million tonnes. Carbon stocks in dead biomass increased from 35.7 to 39.4 million tonnes. The effects of climate change and the consequent growth of calamity felling have meant that the share of conifers in the total recorded standing volume decreased from 41.0% to 37.2% between 2000 and 2017, while the share of broad-leaved trees increased from 59.0% to 62.8%. Changes in the species composition of forests are causing a deterioration in the qualitative structure of volume. The share of roundwood in total coniferous felling is 54% on average and 37% for broad-leaved trees. These changes in the qualitative structure of wood and the development of volume influence the production possibilities for forest fuel biomass. Between 2020 and 2030, planned annual felling will reach 8.9 to 9.0 million m3 of wood thicker than 7 cm, which represents 11.2 to 11.4 million tonnes of above-ground tree biomass (including bark and wood with thickness up to 7 cm). A forecast for the development of the exploitable potential of fuel wood biomass on forest land taking into account biological constraints and current legislation to 2030 is presented in Table 16.

Source: NFC Zvolen In 2017, 9.36 million m3 of fuel wood biomass supply was recorded, with a volume of 0.66 million m3, meaning 7% of total production, while the remainder of the supplies were thin wood, felling residues and bark. The current exploitation rate of available forest fuel biomass resources has reached 51%14 of the exploitable potential (comparing supplies in Table 16 and forecasts in Table 17). The balances of annual greenhouse gas emissions and capture on forest land in the 2010-2017 period according to LULUCF categories are shown in Table 18. Table 18 Balances of annual greenhouse gas emissions and capture between 2010 and 2017 on forest land (Gg) Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Emissions and capture balance -3 756.0 -4 255.9 -5 842.9 -6 686.9 4 466.3 -4 786.7 -4 573.2 -4 448.8 Source: NFC Zvolen Even a potential increase in the supply of forest fuel biomass should not have a significant negative impact on emission and capture balances to 2030. The forecast for the development of exploitable supply potential to 2030 assumes a substantial increase in the share of broad-leaved tree felling, hence a larger share of lower quality wood, small wood pieces and felling residues. The wide scope of calamities affecting mainly coniferous stands is causing the postponement of felling of broad-leaved tree stands to a later period and thus deterioration of wood quality. However, no increase in the total annual volume of planned production is anticipated. The area of forest stands on long-term unmanaged forest land increased from 273 000 to 288 000 ha between 2006 and 2016 and wood stock over 7 cm thick without bark from 38 to 46 million m3.15 The average annual increase in timber of this dimension was 2.07 million m3 and annual extraction was 0.5 million m3. The stock of above-ground tree biomass reached 61.5 million m3 in 2016. The development of the exploitable potential, taking into account biological constraints and current legislation with an outlook to 2030 is presented in Table 19.

According to an assessment in 2016, the carbon stock in living above-ground tree biomass was 15.1 million tonnes and living underground biomass 4.4 million tonnes. Dead wood stock was 1.2 million                                                  14 the Slovak Republic 2015-2016, NFC-FRI Zvolen, 256 p., ISBN 978-80-8093-234-3 15   tonnes. The annual production of solid wood residues in the wood processing industries used for energy purposes was, according to 2016 data, 1.694 million tonnes. Producers own energy consumption was 669 000 tonnes and supplies to market 1.025 million tonnes. Pulp and paper industry companies annually produce around 520 000 t of so-called black liquor for their own energy use. The production of wood processing residues used for energy purposes to 2030 will be affected by: - the development of domestic processing capacities, - the cascade timber utilization rate, - the competitiveness of wood compared to other raw materials, - the development of the fuels and energy markets. In the 2020-2030 period, annual production of solid residues from wood processing is anticipated to be 1.6 - 1.7 million tonnes. The trajectories of the contributions to electricity (Table 9), heat and cold (Table 10) generation, solid biomass part, are used to determine the fuel wood biomass supply trajectories. The trajectory of the demand for fuel wood biomass supply in the 2020-2030 period is valid provided that all solid biomass consumption is covered by wood biomass (Table 20).

The annual exploitable potential of fuel wood biomass on forest and non-forest land and solid residues after wood processing will be in the range of 5.1 to 5.5 million tonnes to 2030. v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, communities generating energy from renewable sources and renewables self-consumers, which are also consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of waste water) National trajectories and plans regarding this point have not yet been approved
