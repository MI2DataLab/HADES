4.6 DIMENSION RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS  Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and its position on the global market As reported in the EU Innovation Scoreboard of 2019, Malta is considered a Moderate Innovator and has shown a performance increase overtime. As stated in the report, Malta has an Innovation-friendly environment and strong employment impacts with respect to knowledge-intensive activities and fast-growing enterprises. This has resulted in Malta ranking as the highest EU Member State when it comes performance is noted to be in its expenditures, specifically in R&I by the public sector and co-funding between the private and public sectors. This is reflected in Eurostat data, with public R&I expenditure at 0.01% of the GDP in 2016 which is low compared to the private and education sectors expenditures of 0.35% and 0.21% respectively. In terms of low-carbon technologies R&I, in 2016, Malta was reported to have the lowest expenditure at 0.002% of the GDP compared to the EU average of 0.027%.

Under the National Integrated Maritime Policy (2015), energy is identified as one of the four main maritime pillars, including a specific emphasis on renewable energy. In particular, the policy notes that the Maltese Government will continue to promote the research into the exploration of blue renewable energy opportunities and encourage further collaboration between research and academic institutions including in the implementation of pilot projects.   National Strategy for R&I, published and implemented by the Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST), energy and low-carbon technologies featured under the theme of resource-efficient buildings. As a result, access to European Structural and Investment Funds for R&I in low-carbon technologies was limited to projects which focused on buildings. This sector was identified with the goal of exploring innovative solutions for improved resource efficiency in new and existing buildings, including through demonstration projects and optimisation.   Funding for R&I in the Field of Low-Carbon Techologies  National Funding Schemes FUSION Programme  FUSION95 is the programme for the disbursement of public funding for R&I support, managed by the Malta Council for Sannually in the period 2018-2020. FUSION is composed of two programmes:  1. The Commercialisation Voucher Programme (CVP): this aims to improve the development and commercialisation potential of innovative research ideas. While the programme does not commercialisation potential of proposed innovative solutions is taken into account in the preparatory stages of the project, including the protection of potential intellectual property.  2. The Technology Development Programme (TDP): this aims to support the actual development of innovative projects proposed by public and industrial entities. TDP provides state financing in the form of grants for research, development and innovation in science and technology.  In terms of energy and low-carbon technology projects, MCST has disbursed approximately 1.17 million between 2015 and 2018 through the TDP. No changes in expenditure expected until 2020, unless additional measures are implemented to increase interest in this field.  Research Innovation and Development Trust The Research Innovation and Development Trust (RIDT) is a funding system established by the Government of Malta in 2011 and run by the University of Malta. RIDT was established to help bolster                                                            95 http://mcst.gov.mt/ri-programmes/fusion/  162  investment in research and development on a national level, with the Trust intended to attract funds from private and corporate bodies as well as foster the commercial exploitation of research within the University of Malta. A project aimed at developing of a model offshore hydraulic energy storage system (FLASC) is one of the projects which has received funding under the RIDT.   The Internal Research Grants Programme  The University of Malta established an internal funding programme, run by the Research Support Services Directorate, to support academics in carrying out their research and act as a springboard to obtain additional funding from other local and foreign sources. The programme offers, on an annual -year period. One project is selected from each of the four identified priority areas: (i) Life Sciences; (ii) Natural Sciences; (iii) Engineering, ICT and Built Environment; and (iv) Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.

TAKEOFF TAKEOFF is a business incubator located within the Centre for Entrepreneurship and Business Incubation (CEBI) at the University of Malta. It works alongside partner agencies in Malta to help people solve real world problems with real solutions. This is done through services such as training for various stages of enterprise growth and three intensive programmes dedicated to different enterprise levels, besides financing and capital. The campus also manages three seed funding programmes, two Maritime Seed Fund AwardsTAKEOFF Seed Fund AwardsFSA).  The former, a collaboration between Malta Marittima and the University of Malta, offers 100,000 in support on an annual basis to finance researchers and entrepreneurs moving towards commercialisation of their maritime-related technologies. The project to develop FLASC was among those projects awarded under this Seed Fund. TOFSA, a joint intitiative between the CEBI and the Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Small Businesses, provides support for the commercialisation of business or research ideas. A total of 100,000 is earmarked for distribution, separated into grants  163  ranging from 2,500 and 20,000. One project that was awarded 20,000 is the Hybrid Boat project; this relates to the prototype of the Innovative Catamaran, a vessel which incorporates the latest technologies in electric drive system, battery monitoring and management, smart charging and flexible photovoltaics with integrated design.  EU LEVEL SUPPORT Horizon 2020 Maltese entities are involved in a number of Horizon 2020 projects under the areas of secure, clean and efficient energy as well as climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials. The total budget of projects under these actions amounts to 108 million, of which approximately 2.67 million has been allocated to Maltese beneficiaries. Of these allocations, the net EU finiancial contribution towards secure, clean and efficient energy amounts to approximately 1.174 million since 2014. Researchers from and Technological Development (FP), under which projects related to the areas of environment (including climate change) and energy amounting to a total of 44 million, with Maltese beneficiaries being allocated less than  and total project budgets amounting to around 14 million. Other EU Funds Operational Programme 1, which mana-CF funds for the 2014-2020 period, provides support for projects within its twelve priority axes; these include low-carbon economy, R&I and low-carbon transport. The total amount of funds available amounts to around 718 million. A number of R&I projects relating to the field of low-carbon technologies have received funding through this million. The Solar Research Laboratory of the Institute for Sustainable Energy (University of Malta), designed with the primary focus of undertaking research on materials used for solar cells, and the Sustainable Living Complex at the University of Malta, were supported by ERDF funds.  ERDF funds were also accessed by Maltese researchers through Interreg Mediterranean and Interreg Europe 2014-2020. Projects which received support in areas relating to low-carbon technologies include: (i) the CONSUME-LESS project, led by the Energy and Water Agency; (ii) PROMETHEUS, coordinated by Transport Malta for a shift in low-carbon technology within the transport sector with emphasis on electric vehicles; (iii) SMART-HY-AWARE, a project addressing the transition to a low-carbon economy of the transport sector with special focus on hydrogen-electric mobility in which Transport Malta is a partner.  National Research and Innovation Projects An initial stock-taking exercise was carried out by the Energy and Water Agency in 2019 to assess the level of domestic R&I in energy and low-carbon technologies from 2010-2018; information on R&I disaggregated to this sectoral level is not yet reported nationally.

To note that until 2013, apart from a number of small renewable energy generators, electricity generation, distribution and supply were provided by a single vertically integrated operator, Enemalta plc. The regulated electricity prices reflected the overall costs incurred by these operations as well as a reasonable rate of return.  The tariffs adopted a rising block structure to incentivise energy efficiency whilst ensuring that industry which have a significant consumption by virtue of their operations would remain competitive on the international market97.   However, with the privatization of the Delimara 3 149MW plant, the construction of Delimara 4, a 205MW plant by a private operator, and the shutting down of both Marsa and the Delimara 1 power plant, almost all of the conventional power generation is now no longer operated by Enemalta.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels the forecasted growth in electricity demand in the foreseeable future. The strategy hinges on an electricity mix made up of renewables, interconnection capacity and high efficiency generators. It is important to note that the generation from renewables and cogeneration continue to benefit from priority dispatch and adequate financial support. Moreover, the Government is currently seeking to obtain the necessary permits for a gas interconnector by 2020, with the aim to have the pipeline commissioned by 2025.  Electricity generation However, the relatively high-cost of the technology compounded with issues of economies of scale has ever since the introductory phase required varying levels of support. Support schemes are issued periodically in line with State Aid Guidelines. Support schemes are usually in the form of feed-in tariffs and/or grants for both residential and commercial systems. Feed-in tariffs are funded from central budget, while ERDF funding is mostly used to fund grants.
