Current interconnection level and main interconnectors  The trends in electricity trading capacity within the interconnected European grid which are used as a basis for quantitative analysis are aligned with the long-term roadmap set out in the 2015 and 2017 Network Development Plans (NDPs) and the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP 2018).

Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including for the year 2030)  The interconnector expansion requirements resulting from changes in the structure of domestic generation and consumption and the European internal energy market are reviewed on a 2-yearly basis in the Network Development Plan (NDP). The current NDP outcomes are published at www.netzentwicklungsplan.de and are used for quantitative analysis purposes when drafting the National Energy and Climate Plan.   4.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructure 4.5.2.i. Key features of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas Electricity The German transmission network for electricity currently comprises around 36 000 km of ultra-high voltage lines (220/380 kV). Further details on electricity infrastructure can be found in section 3.4.1.  Natural gas  Germany has a modern and well-developed gas transmission infrastructure. Network expansion measures for the needs-based optimisation and reinforcement of the network, needs-based expansion of the network and to guarantee security of supply are included in the gas network development plan. This must be produced by the transmission system operators (see section 2.4.2 and further below).  4.5.2.ii. Projections of network expansion requirements up to at least 2040 (including for the year 2030)  Electricity  For expansion of the electricity network, reference should be made to the statements in section 2.4.2.  Natural gas  In the gas network development plan 2018-2028 the transmission system operators present the results of the network development planning including the information obtained during public consultations. The gas network development plan is based on the scenario framework developed by the transmission system operators and confirmed by the Federal Network Agency on 12 December 2017 (cf. Section 2.4.3 iii). The Federal Network Agency approved the gas network development plan 2018-2028 on 20 December 2018. Consequently, this plan is binding for the transmission system operators. It includes a total of 156 measures with an investment volume of approx. EUR 7 billion. Associated with this is the new construction of 1 364 km of gas pipelines and additional compressor capacity of 499 MW.  The transmission system operators are currently drawing up the gas network development plan for 2020-2030. They will consider inter alia the capacity requirements of the three possible LNG projects of private investors in Brunsbüttel, Stade and Wilhelmshaven (see Section 2.3.ii). Publication of the consultation documents for the gas network development plan 2020-2030 is planned for May 2020. After a market consultation and the subsequent review, the transmission system operators will submit the draft of the gas network development plan 2020-2030 to the Federal Network Agency on 1 July 2020 for review. Please refer to the statements in section 2.4.2.  4.5.3. Electricity and gas markets, energy prices 4.5.3.i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices 143   Changes in cross-border prices and consumer prices for natural gas are closely linked to trends in the world market price. Following a significant increase between 2010 and 2012, the cross-border price fell to below 2010 levels after 2015, reaching 1.6 cents/kWh in 2019. The consequences of this development for individual consumer groups differed somewhat. The prices paid by households did not change significantly between 2010 and 2016, but major corporate customers saw prices drop. This was particularly true for energy-hungry companies.  Consumer electricity prices rose between 2010 and 2019 for most consumer groups, by around 4 cents/kWh on average. Industrial customers which consume a lot of energy and occupy a privileged position represented an exception to this rule. The prices paid between these companies between 2010 and 2016 remained almost constant at 5 cents/kWh. This consumer group is exempt from the surcharge under the Renewable Energy Sources Act.  4.5.3.ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures until at least 2040 (including for the year 2030)  Table B20 shows the results of price projections for baseline scenarios investigated. It should be noted that taxes, surcharges and fees are levied on the final consumer prices for natural gas and electricity. These price components refinance grid infrastructure and the growth of renewable energies, for example. Other refinancing routes are, however, conceivable in the interests of climate protection and considerations relating to energy policy and (in particular) distribution policy. Against this backdrop, long-term trends in final consumer prices for fuels and electricity depend on various factors, including (global) price and cost developments, and are correspondingly uncertain. The results must be viewed and considered against this background.  As PtX products are not used in the baseline scenario, the prices indicated here are purely hypothetical. Instead of a cost degression resulting from learning curves and synergy effects, only a low cost degression was estimated for the electrolysers, which only reflects the general technical progress.
