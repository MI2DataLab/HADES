Modernisation of street lighting systems 2023-2030 Ministry of the Economy, , Public Investment Development Agency 0.039 Total effect of measures 21.78 TWh  Brief descriptions of energy efficiency measures are given below:  EE1. Excise duties and fuel taxation. In order to increase energy efficiency in the transport sector, Lithuania has introduced higher excise duties and VAT on fuels, i.e. petrol, liquefied natural gas and diesel. Lithuania has a value added tax rate of 21% on fuel, which is 6 percentage points higher than the EU minimum of 15%. Petrol is subject to a higher excise duty of 21% (+ EUR 0.08/l), and liquefied petroleum gas  243% (+EUR 0.18 /l). The combined effect of higher taxes and excise duties is a price increase of 14.7% for petrol, 5.2% for diesel and 64.7% for liquefied petroleum gas compared to the levels prescribed by the European Union. Taking into account the volume of fuels sold in Lithuania (petrol, diesel and liquefied natural gas) and demand elasticity, as well as the experience of other countries (Sweden, Spain, Germany and Estonia) in calculating the impact of increasing energy efficiency by means of tax instruments on fuel consumption, it is projected that 6 TWh of energy savings will result from higher taxes and excise duties on fuel in 2030.  EE2. Renovation of multi-apartment buildings. Lithuania will continue to prioritise the renovation of multi-apartment buildings and seek to reduce heating costs for consumers and improve living conditions in multi-apartment buildings. The implementation of the Programme for the renovation of multi-apartment buildings will continue and nearly 500 multi-apartment buildings will be renovated each year, with energy savings of 100 GWh. Priority will be given to multi-dwellings which were constructed in accordance with the technical standards of the Construction Regulation in force before 1993. After renovation, the building should qualify for class C and 40% savings should be achieved in the building's energy consumption. By the end of 2030, around 5,000 multi-apartment buildings should be renovated under this measure, saving 5.5 TWh of energy. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 143    EE3. Renovation of public buildings. The current Programme for improving the energy performance of public buildings envisages targets for State-owned public buildings up to 2030. Around 510,000 m2 in central government public building area and around 450 000 m2 in municipal public building area are expected to be renovated by 2030. According to the current legal framework, public buildings must reach a minimum class C after renovation. Around 10 GWh of energy will be saved annually and the overall energy savings from this measure will come to 0.55 TWh approximately.  EE4. Agreements with energy suppliers on consumer education and consulting. Continued efforts will be made to increase consumer awareness and change their habits in the field of energy consumption, therefore the provisions of the Law on Increasing Energy Efficiency concerning agreements with energy suppliers on consumer education and consulting will extend beyond 2020. According to this Law, energy suppliers are obliged to conclude agreements with the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter  Agreements on consumer education and consulting must include: - the scope and timetable of consumer education and consulting; - the procedure for reporting on the scope of consumer education and counselling (form of report, reporting periods); - information on consumer education and consulting measures; - the duration of the agreement and the procedure, and the possibility of extending it; Energy suppliers will ensure the implementation of the scope of consumer education and consulting and of measures provided for in agreements concluded between them or through other persons. Newly established energy suppliers must sign agreements with the Ministry of Energy on consumer education and consulting within 6 months of the date of establishment. This measure is expected to lead to energy savings of 3 TWh due to changes in consumer behaviour.  EE6. Energy saving agreements with energy companies. The Law on Increasing Energy Efficiency sets out a legal framework for energy saving agreements. According to the Law, electricity and gas transmission systems and distribution system operators in which at least 1/2 of the voting rights in the general shareholders meeting are held by the State, either directly or through State-controlled companies (hereinafter referred to as 'State-controlled operators'), have an obligation towards the Ministry of Energy to make public the agreements on energy saving. Other energy companies must also conclude energy saving agreements with the Ministry of Energy. The energy savings of energy companies will be determined in proportion to the final energy to be delivered to consumers over the last few years. Energy saving agreements include the following elements: - the energy savings/GHG reductions to be achieved by the energy company and the timetable for those savings; - the procedure for reporting on energy savings (form of report, reporting periods); - information on energy efficiency improvement measures that will ensure mandatory energy savings; - financial investment indicators for energy efficiency improvement measures and the methodologies for calculating them; - the duration of the agreement and the procedure, and the possibility of extending it; Energy companies are required to save energy according to the levels of energy specified in the energy savings agreements (either on their own or through others) by applying cost-effective energy efficiency 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 144   measure is expected to result in annual savings of around 100 GWh and 5.5 TWh by 2030.  EE7. Replacing boilers with more efficient technologies. The measures set out in the plan will achieve the main target: by 2030, 50 000 domestic boilers will be replaced in households and other heat efficiency improvement measures will be implemented, resulting in savings of at least 200 GWh per year or 11 TWh by 2030. The plan is to upgrade 5,000 boilers in households annually. This measure will compensate up to 50% of the costs of replacing inefficient individual boilers with individual boilers using more efficient technologies for households not connected to the district heating system.  EE5. SPI relief for industrial enterprises. A support mechanism to finance the implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures (recommended in the energy efficiency audit reports) in all major industries in Lithuania. Companies will be reimbursed for the implementation of energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency measures to be implemented are expected to result in energy savings of around 100 GWh annually and 5.5 Twh by 2030.  EE8. Modernisation of indoor heating and hot water systems in multi-apartment buildings. A financial instrument that will encourage building owners to upgrade old elevator-type heating systems into newer single-circuit heating systems. Up to 30% of the investment costs will be reimbursed and around 250 heating substations will be upgraded annually. This would lead to annual energy savings of around 10 GWh, or 0.55 TWh by 2030.  EE9. Improving energy efficiency in enterprises. In order to improve the energy efficiency of businesses, Lithuania has planned a financial instrument that will encourage companies to implement energy efficiency improvement measures identified in the energy audit. It is planned to provide a subsidy for the energy savings achieved and to save 100 GWh annually and close to 5.5 TWh by 2030.  EE10. Renovation of private houses. Financial incentive for private house owners to renovate their homes. It is planned to renew 1,000 private houses each year and save 13.5 GWh of energy. Up to 30% of the investment costs will be reimbursed. Total energy savings by 2030 will amount to 0.742 TWh.  EE11. Modernisation of street lighting systems. Financial assistance to encourage the modernisation of street lighting systems. The aim is to replace and renew about 25% of all luminaires or about 65,000 luminaires by 2030 in Lithuania. Renewal of one luminaire is expected to result in annual electricity savings of around 250 kWh and total electricity savings of around 0.11 TWh by 2030.  Energy efficiency improvement measures in the transport sector. Measures T1, T2 and T3 implemented in the transport sector are listed in Table 3.1.1.1. 'Existing policy measures in the field of transport' and measures T1of these measures on the achievement of the energy efficiency targets is specified Annex 2.  Renovation of buildings Lithuania is currently developing a draft national strategy for long-term support for the renovation of the public and private residential and non-residential building sector and plans to submit the final version of the strategy in accordance with the deadlines set out in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.  To increase and improve the renovation of public buildings, the use of energy services in the public sector 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 145   will continue to be promoted. The Public Investment Development Agency currently plays a key role in promoting and publicising the use of energy services in the public sector. The established Energy Efficiency Fund provides loans or guarantees to energy saving service providers carrying out projects for the renovation of public buildings and upgrading of street lighting through the energy service model. The Fund encourages investment in energy efficiency improvement projects by granting preferential loans for the modernisation and renovation of central government public buildings as well as guarantees for loans granted by commercial banks for the upgrading of street lighting. The Fund amounts to EUR 79.65 million. The main source of information for the public sector is the Energy Efficiency Fund, which finances and advises public building managers wishing to renovate their buildings based on the energy service model. Both the Ministry of Energy and the Public Investment Development Agency organise seminars to disseminate information and encourage public building managers to upgrade buildings based on the energy services model. According to the plan, these activities will continue until 2030. Lithuania has identified potential barriers to the use of energy efficiency contracts up to 2020 and has adopted measures to remove these barriers. No additional barriers preventing the use of energy efficiency contracting have been identified at present.   Publicity of energy efficiency measures In order to increase the scope of energy efficiency improvement, the Law on Increasing Energy Efficiency has established the publicity principle, according to which competent authorities administering energy efficiency improvement measures publicly disseminate information to all market actors, including financial institutions. For example, the Public Investment Development Agency publicly disseminates and coordinates with financial institutions the information on the upgrading and financing of multi-apartment and public buildings and street lighting (for details see www.vipa.lt) and, for example, prior to the adoption of a street lighting financial instrument, the Public Investment Development Agency coordinated it separately with financial institutions. At present the Ministry of Economy and Innovation is publicly disseminating information on available energy efficiency improvement measures in the industrial sector72 to all relevant market actors, including financial institutions. The implementation of these measures will continue until 2030.   Improving energy efficiency in electricity and gas infrastructure In 2015, Lithuania carried out an assessment of the energy efficiency potential of gas and electricity infrastructure and prepared plans for the introduction of energy efficiency measures. These plans were successfully implemented until 2020. Some of the projects are ongoing and will be implemented after 2020. According to available estimates, Lithuania has updated its plans for the modernisation of the gas and electricity transmission and distribution network until 2030.     Table 3.2.2. Measures envisaged in electricity and gas transmission networks                                                            72 For more details see http://eimin.lrv.lt/lt/veiklos-sritys/es-parama-1/2014-2020-m/energijos-efficiency measures 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 146   No Infrastructure project Funding sources envisaged Project status and implementation timetable Social and economic benefits of the project 1. Reconstruction of 330 kV and 110 kV transformer substations and/ or switch yards and power lines Investments from EU Structural Funds Transmission network transformer substations, switch yards and power lines are renovated and upgraded on a regular basis. Ensuring the security of supply of electricity to consumer facilities, increasing security of power supply, reducing the costs of operations and operational management as well as development and modernisation of smart grids will lead to more efficient and secure use of energy and increase market integration of renewable energy sources.* 2. Installation of software for the efficient management of gas flows and interactive exchange of information between transmission system operators and system users Investments from EU Structural Funds Purchase and installation of equipment in 20192021 Increased energy efficiency and implementation of smart gas flow management systems  Also, a 10-cover the period from 2019 to 2028. It focuses on the modernisation of the electricity and natural gas networks. One part of the plan concerns the adaptation of smart technologies. The plan includes the following key measures:  Installation of smart meters. By the end of 2023, ESO plans to install smart meters for its customers who consume about 90% of the electricity distributed. Smart meters will be installed in stages, starting with largest electricity consumers, followed by other consumers. For natural gas customers, smart meters will be introduced if the cost-benefit analysis yields a positive result. Final decisions have not yet been taken, but the scenario of installing smart meters for customers using natural gas for heating is being considered.  In addition to smart meters, there are plans to implement a smart metering system for meter management and reliable data collection, storage and analysis. Upgrading of the information systems In order to optimise the number of information systems (IS) required by ESOs as well as their operation and maintenance costs, system upgrades and functionality development are planned. Major projects; Installation of the Distribution Network Management System (DMS). Currently, controllers use several information systems simultaneously to manage the network. With the help of the new DMS, controllers will monitor and manage the gas and electricity network in real time in one system. This will make it much easier to locate the fault and restart the power supply more quickly. Introduction of the Geographic Information System (GIS) ESO currently operates 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 147   separate GIS systems for electricity and gas networks with outdated technologies and limited deployment of new functionalities. The aim is to introduce a single GIS system that enables ESO engineers to perform equipment maintenance faster, to plan necessary investments and network maintenance, to schedule the connection of new customers faster and to manage electricity losses more efficiently. Introduction of a digital asset management system. The different gas and electricity network maintenance systems currently available to ESO are outdated and their potential for further interconnection and development is limited. The new asset management system for maintaining, managing, planning, maintaining and collecting information on ESOs' infrastructure is expected to be more flexible and efficient.  Installation of a power network management decision-making IS based on BigData. By increasing the amount of remotely monitored and controlled equipment, ESO will collect more network operation parameters. The information gathered will make it possible to analyse the data, improve network maintenance processes and extend the useful life of the asset. The following measures are envisaged: 1. A fault prediction system which, based on network status and weather data, helps identify and prevent network vulnerabilities. 2. A Data Hub to allow customers, suppliers, network operators and other market actors to easily exchange data (access to historical data, switching suppliers, contract information management, consumption data, etc.). 3. A network load management system enabling customers to provide services to network operators and enabling customers to obtain financial incentives at peak network load. The main benefit of the programme is to enable customers to make decisions on energy efficiency and reduction of energy costs based on available accurate data on their consumption. Financing of planned measures in the energy efficiency sector73. The sector requires the largest additional investments. Additional funds are mainly planned for the modernisation of buildings. Considerable investment is needed to improve efficiency in enterprises and public infrastructure (upgrading street lighting). The total financial requirement of the sector amounts to approximately EUR 2,405 million, of which around EUR 810 million will come from public funding and around EUR 1,595 million from private funding. Energy efficiency measures are applied and implemented in different sectors and therefore have different sources of funding. The public portfolio will mainly consist of the 20212027 EU Structural Funds, the Climate Change Programme, State and municipal budgets, and the Life Programme.
