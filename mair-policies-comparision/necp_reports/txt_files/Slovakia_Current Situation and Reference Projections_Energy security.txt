4.4. Dimension: energy security  i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks The main domestic sources of energy are renewables and brown coal. After 2023, when support for the production of electricity from coal is discontinued, we expect a significant decline in brown coal mining. The decarbonisation of the Slovak economy will also involve additional costs, and therefore its implementation will require the sensitive and gradual replacement of high-emission sources with low-emission affordable and cost-effective ones. RES are one of the decarbonisation tools, and therefore other low-emission energy sources will also have their places in the energy mix. Figure 41: Energy mix SR 2017   Key:  Zemný plyn Natural gas Ropa Oil Uhlie Coal OZE RES Jadrové palivo Nuclear fuel  The SR is almost 90% dependent on the import of primary energy sources: nuclear fuel 100%, natural gas 98%, oil 99% and coal 68%. Oil Oil deliveries to Slovakia and transit across its territory are reliable and smooth, in line with the volumes agreed in contracts concluded between Slovak and Russian companies. The continuity of oil supplies is ensured in accordance with the Agreement between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in Long-term Supplies of Crude Oil from the Russian Federation to the Slovak Republic and the Transit of Russian Oil Through the Territory of the Slovak Republic, which entered into force on 1 January 2015 and expires on 31 December 2029. Pursuant to the provisions of Council Directive 2009/119/EC of 14 September 2009, Member States are required to maintain minimum stocks of oil and/or petroleum products of at least 90 days of average daily net imports or 61 days of average daily domestic consumption, whichever is the higher. The SR implemented it by Act No 218/2013, on emergency stocks of oil and petroleum products and on the resolution of oil supply crises, and on a change and additions to certain laws. Further to the aforementioned, the Slovak Republic currently maintains emergency stocks of oil and petroleum products in accordance with the valid legislation. Emergency stocks of crude oil and petroleum products are maintained by the Emergency Oil and Petroleum Products Agency, which was established on 13 September 2013; these stocks are currently maintained at 100.8 days of   average daily net imports. Total emergency stocks are approximately 883 000 tonnes (63% in the form of oil, 37% in the form of petroleum products by category). The Agency owns emergency stocks of oil and petroleum products, arranges their procurement, maintenance and exchange and is responsible for the protection of the state in this segment in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 2009/119/EC. Emergency stocks must be continually ready for prompt issue to resolve emergencies. The emergency stocks minimum limit for the particular calendar year is determined by the Administration of State Material Reserves of the Slovak Republic based on data obtained within the state statistical survey. Emergency oil stocks are held within the Slovak Republic. The Administration of State Material Reserves cooperates with the European Union and the International Energy Agency on the prevention and management of oil emergencies. The Petroleum Security Commission (NESO) is responsible for the security of oil and oil products supply and is an advisory body to the Chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves. The Commission acts in accordance with the applicable legislation of the Slovak Republic and international agreements binding for the Slovak Republic. It monitors and analyses: the state of the oil market, the state of oil security and any imminent or acute state of oil emergency. Members of the NESO Commission are, in particular, important representatives of the petroleum industry, of the competent authorities in the state administration, as well as the Emergency Oil and Petroleum Products Agency. The European Commission (EC) may, in coordination with the Member States, assess the emergency preparedness of individual EU Member States and, if deemed appropriate by the EC, verify the level of emergency stocks. In preparing such assessments, the EC takes account of the work carried out by other institutions and international organisations and consults the Oil Coordination Group set up to prevent crises. In the event of a serious interruption of supplies, a special meeting of this working group may be convened at short notice, or may take place as an on-line consultation.  Electricity Balance of electricity generation and consumption In terms of the electricity balance, since 2007 (after the shutdown of the EBO V1 nuclear power plant) Slovakia has been an importing country, however imports showed a downward trend until 2013. This trend then changed between 2014 and 2018. The trend of increasing import volumes will continue until the AE Mochovce 3 and 4 blocks are put into operation. After the commissioning of Mochovce, Slovakia will become a net exporter of electricity. The main motivation was the trend in electricity prices on the market, which are below the generation costs for some technology types. Total electricity consumption in the Slovak Republic reached 30 947 GWh in 2018. Domestic sources produced 27 149 GWh, and so in 2018 imports were 3 797 GWh (12.3% of consumption in the SR). The main reason was the trend in electricity prices on the market, which are below the generation costs of some technology types in Slovakia. Table 64 Generation, consumption and loading of the electricity grid of the SR 2009-2018 Year Generation [GWh] Total consumption [GWh] Balance [GWh] Average loading ** [MW] Maximum loading [MW] 2009 26 074 27 386 -1 312 3 126 4 131  2010 27 720 28 761 -1 041 3 283 4 342 2011 28 135 28 862 -727 3 295 4 279 2012 28 393 28 786 -393 3 277 4 395 2013 28 590 28 681 -91 3 274 4 178 2014 27 254 28 355 -1 101 3 237 4 120 2015 27 191 29 548 -2 357 3 377 4 146 2016 27 451 30 103 -2 651 3 427 4 382 2017 28 027 31 056 -3 030 3 545 4 550 2018 27 149 30 947 -3 797 3 533 4 506 *Exports and imports are indicated using positive and negative values ** Total consumption divided by the number of hours in the year in question The maximum system load in 2018 of 4 506 MW was recorded at 9:00 am on 27 February, down 44 MW from the previous year. The minimum load (6:00 am on 29 July) was 2 368 MW. Source base of electricity generation in Slovakia The installed capacity of electricity generating plants in the electricity system of the SR reached 7 728 MW in 2018. The transmission system operator has registered no interest in the construction of a significant electricity source of over 50 MW either at present or in the past 5 years. Investors are focusing on the implementation of projects of local importance. Figure 42 Structure of installed capacity in the electricity system of the SR in 2018  Key: FVE Photovoltaic power plant OZE RES ostatne Other vodne Hydro jadrove Nuclear fosilne fossil  Figure 43 Structure of electricity generation in the electricity system of the SR in 2018    Nuclear power plants Nuclear power plants are the most important source in terms of their share of electricity generation (55%). Blocks 1 and 2 of Mochovce power plant were put into operation in 1998 and 1999. Technical modifications have since increased their output to the current 2x470 MWe. The anticipated lifetime of the blocks is 50 years, but if all safety conditions are met they can theoretically be operated until 2058 or 2059. Blocks of the Bohunice V2 power plant were put into operation in 1985 and 1986. Technical modifications have since increased their output to 505 MWe. In addition to electricity generation, the Bohunice power plant supplies heat to Trnava, Leopoldov, Hlohovec and Jaslovské Bohunice. Their theoretical lifespan ends in 2045. At present, block 3 of the Mochovce power plant with an installed capacity of 470 MW is nearing completion. Block 4 is planned to be commissioned after a one-year gap, thus giving the SR 6 nuclear blocks with a total installed capacity of 2 880 MW. Fossil fuel power plants Electricity generation from coal has been falling over the long term. In 2013, the EVO 2 power plant with an installed capacity of 4x110 MW was decommissioned, while since 2014, blocks 1 and 2 of the Vojany 1 power plant have not been operated. Blocks 3 and 4 of the Nováky power plant have been phased out due to technical obsolescence and non-compliance with emission limits. In 2016, another 2 blocks of the Vojany power plant and one block of the Nováky power plant were decommissioned. In total, therefore, 1 210 MW of output has been decommissioned. Of the coal-fired power plants, 2 blocks of the Nováky power plant and 2 blocks of the Vojany power plant are currently in operation. The Nováky power plant with its annual gross electricity generation of approximately 870 to 1 100 GWh consists of Block A with an output of 46 MWe, which supplies heat to the Upper Nitra region, and Block B with an output of 2x110 MWe. The Vojany EVO 1 power plant with its output of 2x110 MW and annual gross electricity generation of approximately 460 GWh is deployed operatively based on electricity demand and market prices. The total share of these  power plants in electricity generation in the Slovak Republic is 7.5% (ENO - 5.9%, EVO 1 - 1.6%). In accordance with the Action Plan for the Transformation of Upper Nitra, the Nováky power plant  after its conversion from solid fossil fuels  can remain the primary heat source for the region. In addition to heat generationn, Martin over 3% of total electricity generation in Slovakia. Another activity is to provide support services for the electricity grid. gas-fired power plant (430 MWe) and Bratislava gas-fired power plant (218 MWe) did not generate electricity for a long period yet have combined potential generation of over 3 TWh. now in operation. The power plant is one of the most modern sources of electricity of its type, especially in terms of power range. The Bratislava power plant currently only provides minimum-volume support services for the system. Renewable electricity sources Of the total installed capacity of hydro plants of 2 542 MWe, 1 626 MWe is in flow-through plants and 916 MWe in pumped-hydroelectric power plant with its installed capacity of 720 MWe. Its annual production (2 200 GWh) represents almost half the total electricity generation of hydropower plants in Slovakia. Photovoltaic power plants expanded most between 2011 and 2013, when 530 MWe of installed capacity was commissioned, representing a total of 530 GWh of electricity generated through annual usability of 1 000 hours. There are currently 5 wind turbines in operation with total installed capacity of 3.1 MW and an annual output of approximately 5.5 GWh of electricity. Wind power plants in Slovakia cannot compete with other sources of electricity. Biomass is currently represented in the energy mix with an installed capacity of 224 MWe and annual generation of 1 185 GWh. Security and reliability of the Slovak power system As regards meeting the criteria and recommendations of the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E), good results have been reported in the past period and the security of electricity supply in Slovakia is at a high level. At the same time, the Slovak Republic is meeting all the objectives of the Commission communication on strengthening energy networks. At all stages of preparation for operation, suitable solutions for the operation of the electricity system of the SR are proposed and the necessary space for maintenance, innovation and construction of power generation equipment is created to ensure the long-term reliable, secure and efficient operation of the system under economic conditions. To address or prevent emergencies, the TSO has a defence plan in place to prevent the occurrence of major disturbances, emergency frequency and voltage change response, and a black-out system recovery plan. Operational safety meets the requirements for electricity transmission and is checked at each stage of preparation for operation annually, monthly, weekly and daily. The release of TS installations is carried out in coordination with neighbouring TS operators at all stages of preparation for operation. ii. Development projections in relation to existing policies and measures up to at least 2040 (including projections to 2030)  Source base forecast to 2030 The development of electricity consumption will depend on the success of energy efficiency measures, respectively energy savings, and speed of development of electromobility.  It is projected that sufficient electricity should be provided and that there is no need to build more larger sources before 2030. Under the anticipated scenario, the available capacity from the net installed capacity of electricity sources is positive to 2030. Upon completion of EMO 3 and 4, the system will be secure from the point of view of electricity generation even if the largest fossil  are not operated.  It is assumed that the total installed capacity will be 8 720 MW in 2030 (7 240 and 9 560 MW under extreme scenarios), of which RES (including the installed capacity of hydroelectric power plants) will be 3 790 to 4 630 MW. The maximum loading will increase in proportion, with a 1.2% year-on-year increase in consumption up to 5 250 MW.  The argument for the current operation of the Nováky power plant is to ensure a secure and reliable electricity supply for the region concerned. After the completion of the reconstruction of the plant in 2023 (conversion to the 400 kV voltage level), this reason will lapse and it will be possible to ensure electricity supply even without the operation of ENO. As ENO A supplies heat to adjacent municipalities and industrial enterprises, there will be a need to ensure the continuity of heat supply.  The long-term operation of the Vojany I power plant (2x110 MW) will only be considered if the return on the necessary investment costs to ensure safe and reliable power output from the power plant to the TS, respectively to the DS, will be acceptable to the facility operator. The Vojany power plant is deployed on a commercial basis and its future operation will remain dependent on the development of prices and market conditions.  Given the development of gas prices in the previous period, the economic efficiency of gas-fired power plants remains a question. A high market gas price and low electricity price would not allow them to operate profitably, and so their future is dependent on the trend in fuel prices and emission permit prices.  By 2030, it will be necessary to address the replacement of approximately 530 MWe of existing photovoltaic power plants that were connected to the grid between 2010 and 2012. These power plants are subject to contracts with a feed-in subsidy guarantee for 15 years, which means there will be a loss of financial support between 2025 and 2027 and we can therefore expect them to be disconnected from the system.  The hydropower potential of the SR is currently utilized at 71% and there is theoretically potential for the construction of new power plants with an installed capacity of 241 MWe and annual generation of 1 900 GWh. Given the investment intensity of construction, the demanding EIA and public opinion turning against such large-scale projects, no significant construction of new hydropower plants is anticipated.   In the preceding period, certificates of compliance of the investment plan with the energy policy were issued for potentially prepared new-source projects:  The  Plant project is aimed at exploiting the unused energy potential of - Hlohovec section for generating electricity of around 180 GWh per year. A dam with a lock is a part of the Váh waterway project and its completion will create a fairway from Komárno to Hlohovec. The main obstacle to the implementation of the work is the long-term return on investment at current electricity prices.  The New Nuclear Source (NNS) at the Jaslovské Bohunice site with a total installed capacity of 1 200 MW would be one of the most promising prospective Slovak energy industry projects if implemented. From the point of view of the overall balance of the Slovak Republic regulatory area, the construction of the NNS would be more effective if it was considered a substitute for the existing EBO V2 power plant. The simultaneous operation of EBO V2 and the NNS would place additional demands on the electricity system of the SR, and extensive investments on the transmission system of the SR side due to the large accumulation of installed power in practically a single point of the transmission system. To ensure the export of electricity abroad, the affected parts of the transmission system of the SR for electricity export would have to be significantly strengthened. The NNS with an installed capacity of 1 200 MW would require additional regulatory power in the defined territory of the Slovak Republic in case of the failure of this large electricity source to ensure compliance with common standards valid in the interconnected ENTSO-E system when the source is connected to the system. In view of the announced EBO V2 lifetime extension, confirmed through the implementation of specific technical and safety measures as required by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority of the SR, and also in view of the need to meet anticipated demand, the commissioning of the NNS will only be possible after 2035.  The construction of the New Nuclear Source would also be in accordance with the direction taken by the Slovak Republic, namely decarbonisation of the Slovak economy. The main parameter for assessing the justification for the construction of the source will be the future development of electricity consumption in the Slovak Republic. The construction of the New Nuclear Source must therefore be conditional on its sufficiency. The projections elaborated within the Low-Carbon Study project confirm the possibility of replacing end-of-life nuclear sources through the construction of the NNS after 2045. The New Nuclear Source will also be assessed in the given period with regard to the most modern existing technologies and its competitiveness (technical and economic).  The wer Project, with a proposed installed capacity of 560 MW, represents significant potential for providing a wide range of support services. This is a weekly cycle pumped hydro source that is able to move weekend surplus energy from nuclear power plants to peak load on weekdays. It is also an optimum balancing factor for the output of wind and photovoltaic power plants. Implementation of the project will depend on the growth of the international electricity market and interest from a strategic investor. It is also possible to assess the feasibility of using hydro energy potential within the comprehensive use of the Danube above Bratislava and increased production of bioethanol at Enviral Leopoldov, with installed capacity of 15 MW in the form of CHP from RES.  Even with the construction of relatively small local, widely distributed power sources with relatively limited installed power, an installed power increase of several tens of MW can be anticipated in the coming years. This generation is highly efficient especially through the use of the latest technologies, esp. CHP, and because of its proximity to the customer does not place increased demands on transmission capacity. 4.5. Dimension: internal energy market 4.5.1. Electricity interconnectivity  i.
