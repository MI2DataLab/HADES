Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 91 of 268  2.4. Dimension 4: internal energy market   2.4.1. Interconnectivity of the electricity grid taking into account EU interconnectivity targets   In 2017, the electricity interconnection level in Austria was 15.3%, and was therefore already been set for 2030 in Austria. However, it is to be expected that, in view of the national target of increase. Austria will therefore also continue to drive forward the socially and environmentally compatible development of the network infrastructure (also see point 2.3 and the measures set out in point 3.4 in this regard)     2.4.2. Development of energy transmission infrastructure in the context of the Energy Union, including Projects of Common Interest where applicable   i. Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy  Our infrastructure must allow for new developments on the energy market, such as decentralised production, new storage technologies and digitalisation. This will be achieved through socially and environmentally friendly development and by modernising the network infrastructure. The planned measures need to be environmentally and eco-friendly and put an end to soil-sealing and the impact on the man-made environment and natural habitats. The aim is also to accelerate and simplify licensing procedures and reduce the level of bureaucracy involved, in line with civil rights and the relevant EU legislation.  The following cornerstones are to be taken into account:   Synchronise grid development with the development of renewable energy The investments made by grid operators make them key enablers for investments in renewable energy. Grid development and the development of renewable energy must take place systemically. Synchronicity and overall planning will bring about security of supply and planning security, as well as saving costs.  Safeguard reserve capacity Reserve capacity should be safeguarded in a cost-efficient manner through the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 92 of 268  market, e.g. by putting capacity out to tender by all potential market operators.  Facilitate local networks and storage facility operations In order to strengthen the market, regulatory barriers to local initiatives in the production, distribution and storage of electricity and heat should be gradually eliminated  Use waste heat Aside from supplying district heat from various renewable energy sources (biomass, geothermal energy, solar thermal energy, photovoltaics, etc.) and combined heat and power, storage of waste heat from production processes will also be vital.  Integrate buildings into the system as storage facilities It will be increasingly possible to use buildings and their energy technology systems as energy storage systems.   In addition, the Network Development Plan (NDP), which describes network planning for the next ten years, taking into account developments in energy performance, sets out important projects in the electricity sector. Similarly, all effective measures to optimise and develop the gas grid in line with demand and to ensure security of gas supply are set out in the long-term plan for the distributors and the coordinated network development plan (CNDP) for the pipelines (see also Point 1.2)  The draft for the fourth PCI list contains the following Austrian PCIs:  Electricity  - 2.18.

Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)    Weinviertel grid r  In order to integrate renewable energy sources into the grid, the transmission network infrastructure in the eastern Weinviertel must be strengthened (replaced) and substations must be developed. To this end, plans are in place for a new 110 kV grid support system in the northern Weinviertel, in the form of the Zaya substation, and a new 220 kV line connection to the Austrian border. With the completion of the 380 kV line, the old 220 kV line from Bisamberg to the Austrian border is to be dismantled.  The replacement of the APG Weinviertel line will result in a 380/110 kV grid system by the end of 2022.  Upper Austria central region  Replacement of the current 110 kV supply lines with 220 kV lines from Ernsthofen/Kronstorf to the motorway intersections and 220/110 kV expansion of the Pichling substation by 2026. The 220/110 kV Wegscheid grid support system is then planned to enter into service in 2028. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 94 of 268   Separation of the 110 kV network in the Upper Austria central region into two sub-networks, on the basis of the increased short-circuit power and so that the 110 kV protection system can continue to operate in a safe and reliable way in the interests of optimum security of supply  Carinthia grid region (interconnection between Lienz and Obersielach)  Improvements to the transmission grid in the Carinthia region and 380 kV ring connection in Austria. Different options are being investigated for the construction of lines aimed at improving the grid in the Carinthia grid area (incl. upgrading the existing line to 380 kV).  220 kV line connecting St. Peter, Hausruck and Ernsthofen (general renovation)  General renovation and the installation of a cutting-edge cable system along the existing road, which is 111 km long. Work began in April 2018.        2.4.3. Market integration   i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a time frame for when the objectives shall be met  Successful transformation of the energy system depends on support for price incentives, energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources. Competitive pricing mechanisms that take account of tax, duty and incentives will be used to minimise market distortions. Households, commerce and industry will be able to participate actively in the energy market and react to price signals.  Market economy energy system If the electricity supply is to be based on renewable energy sources by 2030, functioning, cross-border, liquid wholesale markets and common price zones are needed in order to generate the necessary price signals. The required investments will need to be financed primarily via the market. Market-distorting incentives that conflict with the decarbonisation pathway must be Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 95 of 268  minimised, and undistorted, competitive pricing mechanisms must be (re-)established.  The following cornerstones will need to be taken into account when redesigning the energy system:   Ensuring grid stability  Dividing infrastructure costs fairly The cost of maintaining and developing the network infrastructure needed to transform the energy system must be divided fairly between all network users, even in cases of increasing private generation.  Sending correct price signals to market operators In order to trigger investment and increase flexibility, the market should send out the right price signals. That means permitting intervention in pricing mechanisms. Negative wholesale prices should be avoided in line with European practice.  Improving the internal energy market and increasing flexibility. For storage facilities, see point 2.3, sub-point ii    ii. National objectives (where available) on non-discriminatory access for renewable energy, demand response and storage, including an indicative time frame for when the objectives are to be met  See point 2.4.3, sub-point i. Beyond that, no specific objectives are currently in place.      iii. National objectives (where available) with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and the benefits from self-generation and new technologies, e.g. smart meters    Smart meter roll-out 2019  The introduction of smart meters can be traced back to the EU Electricity Directive from 2009 (Directive 2009/72/EC). In Austria, the legal basis is formed by the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 and the Smart Metering Regulation (IME-VO). By the end of 2020, 80% of meter points are to be converted to new digital meters and at least 95 per cent of households Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 96 of 268  should be equipped with smart meters by the end of 2022 where technically feasible.     iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a time frame for when the objectives are to be met  See objectives in points 2.4.2, sub-point i and 2.4.3, sub-point i. Beyond that, no specific objectives are currently in place.     v. National objectives (where available) to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of energy companies  Household customers: Steps must be taken to prevent climate protection measures from jeopardising the affordability of housing and energy.  In addition, existing efforts for low-income and low-energy households at federal and state level should be supported and improved upon and an overview of the situation should be established. (See 2.4.4., 3.4.4.)  Consumer confidence is key, including in changed energy markets. Where necessary, consumers should therefore be protected and strengthened. For example: Ensure the quality of energy service providers supplying households; take legal action against unfair and misleading practices; local and district heating law, which also includes consumer protection rules; investment in data protection and data security. Care should be taken to ensure that e-charging stations are built so as to be accessible.     2.4.4. National objectives to prevent energy poverty (including a time frame for implementation), where applicable   affordability. Efforts must be made to ensure that all sections of the population can meet their basic energy and mobility requirements. Consumers should be able to manage this now and in future at a socially affordable cost. High energy costs put low-income households in particular at risk of poverty. It is important to incorporate energy poverty into climate and energy targets. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 97 of 268  Economists, politicians and civil society can work together to find social solutions to help mitigate hardship cases. Maximum transparency in the form of easy and fast access to information and further training should be guaranteed in order to increase social acceptance.  Definition of energy poverty -risk-of-poverty threshold and, at the same time, it has to cover above-  In principle, this definition17 is one of several possible approaches to the issue of energy poverty. The definition chosen here has already been used in several projects in the energy sector in cooperation with Statistics Austria, and has been discussed during meetings on energy poverty and during a consultation process. It is also the subject of the recent publication Studie zur Eruierung einer Definition von Energiearmut in Österreich aus Sicht der sozialwirtschaftlichen und energiewirtschaftlichen Praxis18 [Study establishing a definition of energy poverty in Austria from the perspective of socio-economics and the energy sector] by the Vienna University of Economics and Business on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Health and Consumer Protection (BMASGK).     Key analysis results19 -20 household, household energy consumption (heating, hot water, cooking, overall use of electrical energy and other energy uses for the building) is more than 140% of the average household energy consumption. Energy used for mobility is not included in this definition. According to this definition, in Austria in 2013-14, some 117,000 households  around 20.3% of households at risk of poverty, or 3.2% of all households  were affected by energy poverty.  While non-energy-poor households exhibit an average final household energy use of 18,200 kWh per year, this value for energy-poor households is 23,373 kWh (28% higher; for heating the final energy use is 49% higher). While in non-energy-poor households, 66% of final energy is used for heating, in energy-poor households this figure is 77%. The use of electricity is also 9% higher in energy-poor households than in non-energy-poor households.  The average annual energy costs for energy-poor households, in the period in question, is EUR                                                                     17 https://www.e-control.at/en/publikationen/fachpublikationen-endkunden/energiearmut 18 Vienna University of Economics and Business (2018) https://www.sozialministerium.at/cms/site/attachments/2/9/7/CH3434/CMS1535520882546/studie_energiearmut_e ndversion.pdf 19 18 on behalf of the BMNT. 20 See https://www.e-control.at/en/publikationen/fachpublikationen-endkunden/energiearmut Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 98 of 268  2,593, 39% higher than the average for all households, which is EUR 1,868. The difference in the average share of energy costs compared to household income is equally high: the average share for non-energy-poor households is around 4.5%, while for energy-poor households it is 22.8%. The difference between relative share of each energy source within the overall energy costs for both groups of households is particularly high for heating oil: in the period in question, 2013-14, non-energy-poor households show a share of energy costs for oil heating of 14%, while for energy-poor households this share is 21%. On top of the high costs for energy-poor households with mostly oil heating, the high volatility of heating oil prices in comparison with other energy sources leads to increased uncertainty regarding future costs. In general, the main reason for the high energy costs incurred by energy-poor households is the poor thermal quality of the building envelope and the use of an expensive energy source for heating.  According to statistics (EU-SILC), as well as households with oil heating systems, those more heavily affected by energy poverty are households in buildings built prior to 1960, households in one- and two-family houses, households with larger heated living areas, single households and homeowners.  During the period in question, 2013-14, while in buildings built prior to 1960 around 5.1% of households were affected by energy poverty, for buildings built between 1991 and 2005 this figure was only 1.5% and for post-2006 buildings it was 0% (average for all buildings: 3.2%). The percentage of energy-poor households in one- and two-family houses during 2013-14 was 3.8%, while in multi-family houses it was 2.6% (average for all buildings: 3.2%).  Analysis of structural parameters, final energy use and energy costs from the micro-census  confirms these results (primarily based on EU-SILC) and also shows that households with oil heating, but also households with natural gas heating, belong to the group of households with high specific energy consumption values (kWh annual final energy use/m2 of living space), i.e. buildings with poor thermal energy efficiency
