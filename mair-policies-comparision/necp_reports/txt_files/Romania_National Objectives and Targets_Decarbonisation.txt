The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         2. National targets 2.1. The Decarbonisation Dimension6 2.1.1. GHG emissions and removals i. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4 Romania plans to make a fair contribution to the achievement of the decarbonisation target of the EU and will follow the best environmental protection practices. The application of the EU-ETS scheme and compliance with the annual emissions targets for the non-ETS sectors are the main commitments to achieve the targets. For the sectors covered by the EU-ETS scheme, the overall emissions reduction target of Romania reaches approximately 44 % by 2030 compared to 2005.7  Following the projected policies and measures, as detailed in Chapter 3, GHG emissions from the ETS sector for 2030 show a level of 39 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

The European Commission set a 2 % reduction target for Romania compared to the value for 2005,8 whereas the average for EU28 is a 30 % reduction. The implementation of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU may also lead to the achievement of this target by ensuring compliance by each Member State with their provisions and requirements through a maximum compensation of 13.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent for the period 2021-2030.  According to the projections issued during the preparation of the INECP, the total GHG emissions in 2030 (EU-ETS and non-ETS, excluding LULUCF) will be 118.35 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.9 The decarbonisation process will also be influenced by the achievement of the following strategic objectives pertaining to the circular economy: o increasing the municipal waste reusage and recycling rate to a minimum 70 % by 2030 (a minimum of 50 % by the end of 2025); o reducing the amount of stored municipal biodegradable waste to 35 % of the amount of municipal biodegradable waste generated in 1995, by the end of 2020; o by 2025, storing only waste undergoing prior treatment operations; o increasing the package waste recycling rate to 80 % by 2030, with the interim target of 60 % by 2020 and 70 % by 2025; o prohibiting storage of recyclable materials such as plastics, metal, glass, paper and cardboard, and of biodegradable waste by 2025, completely removing storage of waste by 2030; o developing the markets of high quality secondary raw material, including by assessing the value added by the criteria establishing the end of the status of waste applicable to certain materials; o increasing the energy recovery rate to a minimum of 15 % by the end of 2025; o increasing the rate of separate collection of recyclable waste by three fractions (paper and cardboard, plastic and metal and glass) in order to reach a minimum collection rate of 52 % in each county and in the Bucharest Municipality. Romania will therefore contribute to the decarbonisation process of EU28 considering that, in 2030, the total greenhouse gas emissions in the national economy sectors will be reduced by approximately 50 % compared to 1990. This reduction will also result from the sectors covered by the ETS system and from non-ETS activities.  Moreover, GHG emissions are likely to be further reduced, according to the WAM scenario  prepared by the government institutions in Romania have been completed. The following reports will                                                 8 Regulation 2018/841/EU, Annex 1 9 Projections issued in the framework of this Plan, taking into account the projected emission levels in the Seventh National Communication from Romania The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         thus envisage harmonisation with the INECP and the abovementioned assessment is to be included in the future plan revisions. When the INECP was prepared, the Forestry Reference Level (FRL) and the National Forestry Accounting Plan (NFAP) were under development. The updating of the GHG emissions/removals in the LULUCF sector, which is part of the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (INEGES), with an impact on the determination of FRL and of GHG emissions/removals projections, is under preparation. The completion deadline for Biannual Report No 4 is 31 December 201910, and the remaining reports are to follow their normal course in 2020, starting with 15 January, when the INEGES data will be reported to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. When the INECP was prepared, there were no sufficiently advanced draft versions of the indicated documents/reports to extract and to process the data needed for an updated calculation of the GHG emissions target.  In conclusion, the GHG emissions and removals targets, and related policies and measures, will be updated in the INECP after the strategic documents have been completed. ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment to reducing the GHG emissions, other adaptation targets, if available Currently not applicable. 2.1.2. Renewable energy i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 In its setting of the targets for energy from renewable sources, Romania followed the Package. Considering that, in 2017, the global renewable energy share in the gross final energy consumption exceeded the 24 % target undertaken for 2020 (24.5 % in 2017 according to Eurostat), and the expected trend in such share, the projections based on the assumptions used in the development of this Plan indicate a global RES share of 30.7 % for 2030.  The calculation methodology set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources was used in the calculation of the global RES share in the final energy consumption.                                                   10 https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/SubmissionsStaging/NationalReports/Documents/3791685_Romania-BR4-1-BR4-Romania.pdf The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Chart 2  Indicative trajectory of the RES share in the final energy consumption, 2021-2030, [%]  Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional    RO EN Ponderea SRE Ã®n consumul final brut de energie  RES share in the gross final energy consumption  RGUE Interim targets calculated under EUGR  The RES target at interim points was calculated as the minimum value indicated in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, namely:  By 2022, the trajectory must reach the target of at least 18 % of the total increase projected in the period 2020-2030 compared to the target projected for 2020 (24 %);  By 2025, the trajectory must reach the target of at least 43 % of the total increase projected in the period 2020-2030 compared to the target projected for 2020 (24 %);  By 2027, the trajectory must reach the target of at least 65 % of the total increase projected in the period 2020-2030 compared to the target projected for 2020 (24 %) In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, the assessments made during the preparation of the Plan show that the interim targets for 2022, 2025 and 2027 were met and exceeded respectively. The level of ambition regarding the share of energy from renewable sources has increased in the revised version of the INECP from an initial proposed rate of 27.9 % to a revised rate of 30.7 June 2019, and the opinions and comments received during the public consultations. Projections for the 28 EU Member States (2016-207and Prognosis Commission (- CNSP) prepared and submitted new macroeconomic projections. Moreover, the decrease in the cost of RES technologies has influenced the projected increase in these capacities and the coupling with other measures to increase the flexibility of the system will offset the decrease in the share of coal-based electricity taking account of the costs for compliance with the environmental requirements.  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Romania has chosen to adopt a relatively prudent approach to the level of ambition, taking into account the national particularities pertaining to the stability and safety of the NES, and to the demand for storage capacities as well as the impact of investment costs on the price to the consumer, and having regard to the fact that Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 stipulates that, in future revisions of the INECP, shares may be adjusted only upwards. In the context of designing this approach, it is noteworthy that, in the process of implementation of the recommendations, there was also the issue of absence of the data required to increase the level of ambition in the area recommendation by the Commission and to prepare a more detailed plan regarding the measures, actions, and financial resources envisaged by the Romanian authorities in order to achieve the RES targets in the period 2021-2030. For example, the fact that no official data is currently available regarding the actual potential of biogas and biomass resources at national level, which is also hindered by the existence of an unclear legislative framework in this field, which does not enable a clear classification of certain natural resources as biomass (one example in this respect is firewood, i.e. a resource widely used in the rural area as fuel for heating), constitutes an additional constraint. Such  Nevertheless, considering that there are no legislative barriers to the increase in the RES capacities and in the availability of certain funding instruments for 2021-2030, which are particularly RES-friendly, it will be possible to develop them according to the market demand and the developed capacities will be able to exceed the value currently proposed in the Plan if the market demand and the actual exploitable potential will allow it. Moreover, a new assessment/adjustment of the target for 2030 will be possible with the revision of the INECP, when a series of strategies, which are still under development, have been completed and approved and when it will also be possible for the effects of the implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/410 and of the Green Deal support programmes to be known and estimated much better at national level. ii. Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector The total renewable energy share in the gross final energy consumption includes the renewable energy contribution of each sector to the final energy consumption. The sectoral renewable energy shares were calculated in accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, including relevant annexes, as the methodological basis.   The contribution of Romania to the achievement of the targets set for 2030 is shown in the charts below based on the WAM scenario and on the calculation assumptions and projections used. Chart 3 - Indicative trajectory of the RES share in the gross final electricity consumption, 2021-2030  Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional   The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         RO EN SRE-E RES-E  The normalised values of the electricity produced from a hydro-power and wind source were used to calculate the RES share in the gross final electricity consumption, as per the methodology described in Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Annex II.  Chart 4 - Indicative trajectory of the renewable energy share in the gross final electricity consumption in the sector of heating and cooling, 2021-2030  Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional   RO EN SRE-Ã&R RES-H&C  According to the calculation assumptions used, the gross final consumption of renewable energy used in the I&R sector is estimated to increase by 24 % in the period 2021-2030, considering the availability of the biomass sources (mainly firewood and agricultural waste) in accordance with the sustainability criteria. An alternative for 2030 is the introduction of the heat pumps to meet the heating demand (against the background of an estimated decrease of at least 25 % in the costs for heat pumps in 2030 compared to the current values, without taking into account the support measures at national and European level, which are likely to lead to an even more significant decrease in these costs11), and the installation of solar panels on roofs. The calculation assumptions took into account the most cost-effective investments in order to cover the domestic heat demand, considering the estimated increased availability for use of natural gas in the heating processes and the dispersion of households/inhabitants in the rural areas of Romania. Romania is facing certain constraints in order to reach the indicative target under Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, also because the RES share in the heating and cooling sector is already relatively high, being estimated to 25.6 % in 2020. This is due to the significant share of biomass used nationallydefinitions. However, the topic is sensitive to Romania because there are no accurate statistics regarding the actual biomass potential12 at national level and the vague legislative framework in this field leads to certain uncertainties regarding the classification of certain resources, such as firewood, which is widely used especially in the rural areas, as biomass. Moreover,                                                 11 Technology pathways in decarbonisation scenarios, E3 Modelling, Ecofys, Tractebel, July 2018  12 Preliminary indications in this respect are set out in the National Forests Accounting Plan for Romania, which was launched for public consultation on 6 December 2019 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         considering that this target is expressed as a ratio between the RES quantity and the gross final energy consumption, both variables may influence the target value. Uncertainties regarding the gross final energy consumption, which is likely to be affected by various factors such as weather conditions or volume and type of industrial activity, may therefore result in difficulties in achieving the target in the I&R sector. Romania will make efforts, as described in the plan, in order to increase the level of ambition in the RES field, however it considers it noteworthy to take into account the abovementioned difficulties and constraints. The RES target in the heating and cooling sector was updated to take into account, in addition draft Long-Term Renovation Strategy prepared by the Ministry of Public Works, Development and Administration. Moreover, the RES target was updated to take into account also the sustainable use of biomass in the energy sector.   In the context of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, Romania plans to explore various methods in order to overcome the abovementioned structural obstacles with a view to reaching the indicative target of 1.3 % per year by 2030.  Chart 5 - Indicative trajectory of the renewable energy share in the gross final electricity consumption in the transport sector, 2021-2030  Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional   RO EN SRE-T RES-T  For renewable energy in the transport sector, a European target of 14 % of the final energy consumption in transport for 2030 was set for each Member State. The projections of the plan indicate a surge in electrification in the transport sector based on the identified set of priorities and on the assumption of convergence of costs for light electric vehicles and those of internal combustion vehicles in 2024 according to independent studies13. By 2030, approximately 700 000 private electric vehicles (including hybrid vehicles) and approximately 600 000 charging points (of which approximately 40 000 under a fast-charging and semi-fast charging regime) are thus estimated to be put into circulation. The target for 2030 takes into account the current RES-T share (6.56 % for 2017) and, implicitly, the efforts required to reach a value of 14.2 % in 2030.                                                 13 Energy Transition Outlook 2018, Executive Summary, A global and regional forecast to 2050, DNV-GL The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The calculation methodology described in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources was used in the calculation of the renewable energy share in the gross final energy consumption in the transport sector. The multipliers used in the RES-T calculation after 2020 were thus listed in Article 27 of the abovementioned directive, namely:  the share of biofuels and biogas for transport produced from the feedstock listed in Annex IX was considered to be twice its energy content (x2);  the share of renewable electricity used in road transport was considered to be four times its energy content (x4);  the share of renewable electricity used in rail transport was considered to be 1.5 times its energy content (x1.5). Moreover, in the calculation of the target account was taken of the fact that the share of biofuels and bioliquids, and of biomass fuels consumed in transport (conventional biofuels) would not exceed more than 7 % of the final energy consumption in the road and rail transport sector, as stipulated in Article 26 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. iii.

Projections for 2030 reflect an increase of up to 5 255 MW in the wind capacities and of approximately 5 054 MW in the photovoltaic capacities, as illustrated in the graph below. As regards the projected trend in the natural gas-fired capacities, although the Development and Decarbonisation Plan for CE Oltenia 2020-2030 presents an additional natural gas-fired capacity of 1 400 MW as from 2024 (for more details, please see Section 3.3.i), considering the age of the current natural gas-fired capacities, it has been estimated that the decrease due to their decommissioning will exceed the increase foreseen through the new capacities. Nevertheless, the gross energy production from natural gas will increase (based on the increased efficiency of new capacities and the increase in the level of use of existing ones).

Moreover, by 2027-2030, in addition to deploying additional wind and solar capacities, it will be necessary to keep the existing capacity by repowering. In this respect, the capacities resulting from the repowering considered during the preparation of this Plan are:  Wind  ~ 3 GW installed capacity from repowering;  Solar  ~ 1.35 GW installed capacity from repowering. An approximate 2.7 % increase is projected for gross final energy consumption in the period 2021-2030, according to the WAM scenario, with a significant increase by 2025, followed by a drop due to the energy efficiency measures, as also shown in the chart below. Such consumption is broken down by the three relevant sectors: heating and cooling, electricity and transport. According to the calculation projections, the heating and cooling sector for 2030 is responsible for approximately 50 % in the gross final energy consumption.
