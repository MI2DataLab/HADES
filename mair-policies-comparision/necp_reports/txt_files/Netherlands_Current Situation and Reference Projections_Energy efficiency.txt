Similar to final energy consumption, primary consumption shows a slight downward trend between 2000 and 2017. Since the oil crisis in the early 1980s, primary energy consumption has increased, and continued to do so up to 2010. At the time consumption was around 3,003 petajoules. Consumption subsequently decreased dramatically. Consumption in 2017 was circa 10% below the 2010 level, while gross national product increased by 15% during this period. Energy intensity also decreased during this period. Moreover, during this period, consumption of natural gas experienced the sharpest fall, from over 1,364 petajoules in 2000 to over 1,187 petajoules in 2017, a 13% reduction. This decrease was primarily caused by declining final consumption of natural gas for heating purposes. Natural gas is the principal energy source for heat consumption. The contribution of natural gas to electricity generation has also declined. In contrast, consumption of both renewable energy sources and coal showed an increase during this period. Consumption of renewable sources increased by 81%, with coal consumption increasing by 20% between 2000 and 2017 as a result of the commissioning of three new coal-fired power plants. The rise in coal consumption at the expense of natural gas consumption was also the result of price developments. The consumption of crude oil and nuclear fuels in 2017 were slightly lower than the level in 2000. Between 2000 and 2017, non-energy consumption increased from 474 to 568 petajoules. Figure 4.11 Situation and projection for primary energy consumption per energy carrier (including non-energy consumption) (Sources: Eurostat (situation) and PBL, 2019a (Forecasts with adopted policies)) Petajoules                                                  117 In these sections, primary energy consumption and final energy consumption are based on the Eurostat "2020-2030" definition (both excluding non-energy consumption). The draft NECP still applied the national definition, according to CBS, which is largely consistent with the new Eurostat definition.

The decrease is mainly the result of reduced consumption by households. Final consumption decreased by 11% from 2000 onwards. This is partly due to improved insulation in homes and efficiency improvements of the heat supply, both through renovations and through new construction. This contrasts with the fact that electricity consumption rose during this period due to an increase in the use of electrical devices. Between 2000 and 2017, total final consumption in industry decreased by 7%. In transport and mobility, between 2005 and 2010, consumption was on the rise, but by 2017, consumption ended up 2% below the level of 2005, due to more fuel-efficient cars, moderate economic growth and a shift in motorists refuelling across the border mainly between 2012 and 2014. In agriculture, including in greenhouse horticulture, final energy consumption fell by 10%. Energy consumption for heat fell due to a reduction of the acreage occupied by greenhouses and improvements in efficiency, whereas electricity consumption doubled due, for example, to lighting intensification. Figure 4.12 Situation and forecast for final energy consumption per sector (excluding non-energy consumption) (Sources: Eurostat (situation) and PBL, 2019a (Forecasts with adopted policies)) Petajoules 2,500 2,000 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    4.3.2 Forecasts for energy consumption Use of fossil energy carriers is gradually decreasing Primary energy consumption is expected to decrease with the "adopted policies" policy variant to 2,601 petajoules in 2020 and to 2,374 petajoules in 2030. This is still above target consumption of 1,950 petajoules by 2030. Consumption of natural gas will decrease (see Figure 4.15) due to the continued reduction of the use of natural gas in the (primarily decentralised) generation of electricity through cogeneration and reduced demand for natural gas to heat buildings. Although the opening of three new coal-fired power plants and low coal prices have led to an increase in coal consumption in recent years, the closure of five coal-fired power plants that has taken place in recent years will result in coal consumption being lower than in 2017 by 2020. For the time being, crude oil will maintain its dominant position as a fuel in transport and as a raw material in the chemical industry. Consumption of crude oil will remain roughly the same, at the level of 2005. It is expected that, in the years to come, crude oil will overtake natural gas as the principal energy carrier in the energy mix. Without new investments, the closure of the nuclear power plant in Borssele in 2033 will bring an end to the contribution of nuclear energy to the energy mix. The contribution of renewable sources is expected to increase significantly in the years to come, primarily due to the growth of renewable electricity production (see Section 4.2.2).  Final energy consumption continues to decline After 2015, final energy consumption increased once more, probably due to the improving economy. This recent increase in consumption is not expected to continue; the projection foresees a downward trend. Final energy consumption is expected to fall in the policy variant of "adopted policies" to 2,080 petajoules in 2020 and 1,997 petajoules in 2030. This is still above target consumption of 1,837 petajoules by 2030. This further decline is chiefly caused by a continued decrease in the consumption of heat in the built-up environment due to demolitions, new construction projects and further energy savings. Final energy consumption in the other sectors will remain relatively constant in the period up to 2020. In many cases, this development is the result of increasing levels of activity that are compensated by increased energy efficiency. Uncertainty about the scope of economic activities is one of the key uncertainties, which could result in projected energy consumption turning out higher or lower. Expected final consumption in the built-up environment is decreasing primarily due to the increase in insulation measures, efficiency measures and the number of heat pumps. In industry, consumption of heat and electricity is expected to remain the same, although non-energy consumption will increase slightly. The use of CHP in industry is decreasing due to adverse market conditions (see also Section 4.3.3). Several sub-sectors in industry show a difference in growth or a decrease: the metallurgical industry assumes growth, despite the uncertainty surrounding aluminium production. The food and beverage industry assumes its growth of recent years will continue, albeit at a more moderate pace. The production volume in the paper industry will shrink. The production of glass will decrease due to the closure of a glass factory in 2017. Production of the building materials industry is expected to increase in the future as a result of organic growth. It is assumed that the production of cobbles will come to an end in 2019, given that marlstone extraction operations in Limburg are to be terminated at that time. Traffic volume will increase due to economic growth, which compensates for increasing efficiency. Energy consumption for passenger transport will decrease due to increasing efficiency, but it will increase in cargo transport by road and in shipping. In agriculture, final energy consumption will decrease due to savings and sustainability improvements in energy consumption. Anticipated energy savings well above EED target Article 7 of the European Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) requires the Netherlands to achieve cumulative energy savings of 482 petajoules between 2014 and 2020. Only energy savings attributable to Dutch policy will count towards the target. According to RVO's monitoring data, the Netherlands will save 516 petajoules with the measures taken between 2014 up to and including 2017. This is more than is necessary to meet the obligation of 482 petajoules. The savings will be further increased by savings measures between 2018 and 2020, but this is no longer relevant for achieving the goal. For the 2020-2030 period, Article 7 of the EED sets a preliminary target of 925 petajoules in final terms. For the Netherlands, the total EED savings based on both adopted and proposed policies are expected to be between 556 and 691 petajoules. Savings achieved exclusively with adopted policies are not known. For a more detailed explanation, see the Notification under Article 7 (Appendix III) Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   4.3.3 Developments and potential for combined heat and power and district heating and district cooling118118 CHP generation has decreased Following a strong rise in combined heat and power (CHP) systems in agriculture and horticulture between 2007 and 2010, virtually no new CHP systems have been introduced since then. In recent years, the number of systems remained reasonably stable, although there was a decrease in the production of electricity and heat (water/steam), due to the unfavourable price ratio between natural gas and electricity at the time. On the basis of the figures for 2017, the percentage of CHP in respect of total electricity production is roughly 38%. The heat and electricity supplied is generated from natural gas to an amount of approximately 64% and the remainder is mainly generated from fuel waste, process gas and, for a small part, from coal. The efficiency gain based on total fuel consumption in 2016 compared to separate generation can roughly be estimated at 20%. Figure 4.13 Development of heat and electricity generation by CHP in the 2000-2030 period (Sources: CBS (situation) and PBL, 2019a (Adopted policies forecast))   1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030  ----- Electricity (situation)  ----- Heat (situation) ----Electricity (forecast) ----Heat (forecast) CHP will continue to decrease in years to come With the adopted policies variant the use of CHP is expected to see a further decline in the years to come (see Figure 4.13). The expectation is that the use of central CHPs (for district heating) will mainly decrease. The decentralised CHPs in industry and greenhouse horticulture remain profitable with the expected gas and electricity prices until 2030. Small percentage of district heating in the Netherlands Due to the extensive gas infrastructure in the Netherlands, natural gas is the most common form of heating for buildings. In 2017, a total 20 petajoules of heat was supplied via 17 major networks and a further 2.2 petajoules through smaller networks (ECN and Statistics Netherlands, 2017). In total, some 400,000 homes are connected to a heat grid, which corresponds to 5.5% of the number of homes in the Netherlands. The number of connections has grown since 2010 (4.6%), chiefly due to the completion of a number of major new construction projects.                                                  118 In accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU.

Smaller projects will experience similar growth, amounting to a total of 27 petajoules by 2023. Further growth towards 40 petajoules is foreseen in the Climate Agreement, but will depend on the policies adopted. Various industrial complexes also make use of a heat grid. It concerns steam production, usually from a CHP. In total, this amounted to 35 petajoules in 2017 (ECN and Statistics Netherlands, 2019). This is more than all district heating combined (22 PJ). There is very little information available about these networks and their development. It is expected that some growth will still take place due to various initiatives for industrial heat exchange. 4.3.4 The development of energy performance standards in the built-up environment Historic development of energy performance standards in the built-up environment In December 1995, the energy performance standard for new buildings was introduced in the Netherlands and requirements were included in building regulations for the minimum energy performance of new buildings, the so-called Energy Performance Coefficient (EPC). The EPC reveals building-specific energy consumption. This consumption relates to heating, hot water supply, ventilation, lighting and cooling of a building, based on a standard resident/user. It does not include energy consumption, for example, for cooking, washing and watching television. In addition, the EPC assumes a standardised outdoor climate and standardised use of the building. The level of the EPC requirements for non-residential buildings depends on the building's function. For example, a distinction is made between buildings with an educational function and buildings with an office function. Between 1995 and 2015 inclusive, the EPC standards were made more stringent on several occasions, to encourage energy savings and to ensure that the measures were technically and financially feasible for all buildings. As a result, and in accordance with the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), the aim is to achieve cost-effective and cost-optimal policies within the built-up environment. Cost-optimal energy performance standards for the built-up environment Under the EPBD II (2010/31/EU), Member States must report on the cost-optimal level of the minimum energy performance requirements every five years. In March 2018, the Netherlands submitted the accountability report to the Commission for the 2013-2018 period (Arcadis, 2018). This study included calculations designed to determine the cost-optimal level for the energy performance of buildings. However, it is often difficult to accurately establish the cost-optimal level; a cost-optimal range is produced. Current energy performance requirements for new buildings, according to the financial calculation, fall within this cost-optimal range. According to the macro-economic calculation, the results for all building and element studies in general are comparable to the financial calculation, which means there are no other insights in relation to the cost-optimal level. Nevertheless, there are still marked differences. This is partly the result of the reduction of CO2 emissions that are included in the macro-economic calculation. In addition, the macro-economic calculation uses a lower discount rate compared with the financial calculation. The Netherlands chose to use the financial calculation as a basis to determine the cost-optimal level. In accordance with European Regulation (244/2012) the requirements must be tightened if the cost-optimal level of the situations subject to building regulation requirements that were studied deviates more than 15% from the established requirements. At present, this study does not currently point to such a situation, with the exception of land-based holiday homes. This means the energy performance requirement for this type of residence should be stricter. The potentially stricter requirements will be included in the cost-optimal level study for new nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs). Expected developments surrounding energy performance in the built-up environment As of 1 July 2020, all permit applications for all new buildings, both residential and non-residential, must satisfy the requirements for nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs). NZEBs are a result of the Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth and the EPBD. Energy performance for nearly zero-energy buildings is determined based on three requirements: 1. The energy requirement in kWh per m² area of use per year; 2. Primary fossil energy consumption in kWh per m² area of use per year; 3. The share of renewable energy as a percentage. In June 2019, the new methodology to determine the energy performance of buildings, the NTA 8800, was published. On the basis of this methodology, the energy performance can be determined for both the existing construction (during Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   renovation) and for a new construction. In May 2019, the cost optimisation study was completed, which assesses whether the NZEB requirements are at a cost-optimal and cost-effective level. The House of Representatives is to decide on the final NZEB requirements during the course of 2019. They are expected to be published in the Bulletin of Acts and Decrees after the summer of 2019. Subsequently, the laws and regulations will be amended, to allow the new methodology and NZEB requirements for new buildings to come into force as of 1 July 2020.
