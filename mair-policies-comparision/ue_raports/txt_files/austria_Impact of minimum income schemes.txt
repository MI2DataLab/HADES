Impact of MI schemes  UA together with  MMI/SA  is likely to have a  substantial impact on poverty alleviation and on reducing the poverty gap faced by  recipient households. MMI/SA provides a very substantial part of the household income34 for around 207,000 people in 2020, of whic h around 75,000 were children.35 As MMI/SA is a benefit of “last resort”, this  32 For  the full text of t he decision by the Constitutional Court see: https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Vfgh/JFT_20191212_19G00164_00/JFT_20191212_19G00164_00.html   33 This is also caused by the fact that the concrete implementation rules of MMI / SA leave con siderable room of discretion for implementing bodies (Leibetseder et al . 2015; Meier/Tiefenbacher 2019).  34 For actual average ben efit le vels according to household constellations, see: Statistik Austria: https://www.statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=118663 .  35 Satistik Austria: https://www.statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=068820 .

Regarding UA, registry data by the PES recently indicated an average number of  around 177,500 benefit recipients in 2020 (Arbeitsmarktservice 2021, 80). However, it should be noted that – according EU -SILC data for 2019 – around 675,000 people each year live in households where at least one member (at least temporarily) receives UA.  If UA did not exist, estimates/simulations suggest that only around half of the affected households could receive MMI/SA instead, whereas the other half would not be eligible to MMI/SA due to stricter means -testing (Kranawetter et al . 2018). If UA did not exist, the total at -risk -of-poverty rate would increase from 13% to 14% (i.e. the number of people affected would rise by around 120,000), and the total poverty gap would increase from 20% to 23%.36 Irrespective of these positive effects,  some substant ial challenges are nonetheless evident , as follows.   Benefits from unemployment insurance are, in principle, calculated according to a linear benefit formula, resulting in rather low benefits for people with previously low income from gainful employment.   At the same time UA is in principle available without a maximum time limit, but for many recipients benefit caps apply; and low benefit levels, resulting from the largely linear benefit formula, mean that top -up payments from MMI/SA are very common.   Furtherm ore, it should be borne in mind that UA is only granted to people who are fit and available for work.   At the same time the benefit levels of MMI/SA  (together with universal family allowance) only just about reach the level of the extreme poverty threshold (40% of the median equivalised household income) , and households of recipients of MMI/SA  are much more often affected by severe material deprivation than other groups.   Furthermore, non -take -up regarding MMI/SA, estimated at around 30%, continues to be a pr oblem.   Another point worth stressing is that it appears that the institutions responsible for implementing MMI/SA  usually do not provide an integrated provision of targeted social services and that they also lack the resources to serve as a well  establishe d link to such services offered by other service providers.  A general major problem is caused by the governance structure of MMI/SA. The Basic Social Assistance Act of 2019 stipulates maximum standards, and minimum national standards no longer exist. At the same time, legislation by federal provinces on MMI/SA leads to substantial variation between federal provinces regarding concrete rules on access, benefit levels, and implementation procedures. Evidently, the situation is therefore characterised by a l ack of effective co -ordination.37  36 Microsimulation results done with SORESI/EUROMOD, based on EU -SILC 2019.  37 This applies irrespective of the fact that after the Basic Social Assistance Act  was enacted a platform for a regular exchange of expert experience  on SA  was established by the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection.  Besi des exchanging experience, the purpose of these meetings is – in particular – to discuss technical and legal questions regarding the Basic Social Assistance Act and the legislation of the federal provinces. It also  addresses  issues, which the federal provi nces wish to discuss in a bigger circle (e.g. disciplinary implementation matters, execution questions and case law)  and  offers the opportunity to discuss possibilities for improvement together with colleagues from the other federal provinces (mutual learn ing) and for develop ing solutions for specific problems.  However, this platform tends to be an instrument of “soft governance”, with hitherto limited impact on actual policy outputs outcomes regarding effective co -ordination in the sense of minimum standar ds regarding regulations and implementation.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  18   A related situation applies regarding empirical evidence on the actual impact and broader outcomes of MMI/SA  and its actual interaction with UA. This is caused by the variation  between the MMI/SA  schemes of the federal pr ovinces mentioned above, which makes proper evaluation difficult and resource -intensive. In this regard  only some basic data on the implementation of the MMI/SA  schemes are  available at the central level, which is compiled by Statistik Austria.38 The Feder al Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection recently commissioned an evaluation study on the MMI/SA  schemes of the federal provinces . The results of the evaluation study are expected for the first quarter of 2023. The aim of this st udy is it – among other things – to analyse, how “poverty -proof” the last safety net is and to identify development potentials with regard to the Basic Social Assistance Act.                             38 See: https://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/mensch en_und_gesellschaft/soziales/sozialleistungen_auf_landesebene/mindestsicherung/index.html .
