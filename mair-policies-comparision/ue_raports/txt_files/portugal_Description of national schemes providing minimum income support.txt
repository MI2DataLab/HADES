Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  The social insertion income ( Rendimento Social de Inserção  – RSI)1, first introduced in 1996 (Law 19 -A/1996) under the name ‘minimum guaranteed income’ ( Rendimento Minimo Garantido  - RMG), came to fill a gap in the Portuguese social protection system. The scheme is based on three basic pillars: i) distribution of resources ; ii) management of social risks; and iii) promotion of social inclusion. It is aimed at ensuring that individuals and their respective households have resources that contribute to the satisfaction of their basic needs and favour progressive professional and social integration.  Apart from the income support (cash benefit) element, the RSI consists of an integration programme. Through the latter, recipients are encouraged to participate actively in their own process of social inclusion and to strengthen the ir capabilities. The integration programme is based on an insertion contract, signed by the beneficiaries and the scheme’s local units, whereby both parties agree to develop a set of actions and tasks necessary for the gradual social, labour market, and co mmunity integration of the family. Claimants , as well as other household family members,  must sign this contract within the first 45 days in order to continue to be entitled to the benefit.  The Social Security Institute is the entity responsible for regul ating and financing the scheme at the national level. The Social Security Institute is made up of regional -level departments. However, only the autonomous regions of Azores and Madeira, where there are regional equivalents of the Social Security Institute,  have responsibilities in terms of regulation and implementation at the regional level. This is not the case in mainland Portugal, where regions do not have that kind of autonomy.   1 Legal framework provided by Law nº. 13/2003 of 21 May.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  3  Implementation is handled at the local level by the scheme’s local units, w hich are made up of local representatives of public bodies in social security, employment and vocational training, education, and health, and by local authorities. Representatives of public/private bodies of non -profit entities that operate in the geograph ic areas in question may also be invited to play a role. As from April 2022 , the co -ordination of the units became the responsibility of municipalities ( until then  it was the responsibility of local services of social security). The units’ competences incl ude approving the insertion agreement, organising its implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.  In 2020, total expenditure on the scheme amounted to €339.7 million. For mainland Portugal (excluding the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores) the to tal was €309.8 million. The latter amount2 was divided between payments to non -profit organisations (8.9% or €27.6 million) and those to recipients (91.1% or €282.2 million).  In 2021 , the scheme had 261,992 recipients (52% females and 48% males). The mean  amount of the benefit was € 119, 39 per  month. 31,2 % of recipients were aged under 18; 10,0 % were aged 18 -24; 10 ,2% aged 25 -34; 12,4 % aged 35 to 44; 15% aged 45 -54; 17,2 % aged 55 -64 and 4,0% aged 65 or over.  In terms of household characteristics  (2020) , 44% of recipients lived in single -person households; 22% lived in lone -parent households; and an additional 22% in households formed by a couple and children. 7% were couples without children, and 3% were extended families.  Approxim ately 1 in 5 recipients received the benefit for one year or less, and about 1 in 4 for more than a year and up to three years. A significant proportion of recipients received the benefit for at least six years (36.4%). On average, recipients received the benefit for 36 months.  Unemployed people who have exhausted their unemployment insurance, or who are not eligible for it due to a short employment record, may be eligible for the means -tested unemployment assistance. The minimum employment record needed fo r access is 180 days in the 12 months prior to unemployment. In order to be eligible, the equivalent personal income of unemployed people cannot be higher than 80% of the value of the social support index ( Indexante dos Apoios Sociais  – IAS)3 (i.e. €354.5 6  in 2022 ); and the households’ assets cannot be higher than € 106,368 – 240 times the value of the IAS in 2022 . It has a minimum duration of 150 days and a maximum duration of 540 days, depending on the age of the claimant and of their contribution (emplo yment) record. The amount received relates to the value of the IAS and to the type of household: 80% of the IAS for beneficiaries living alone, and 100% for beneficiaries living with other people.  1.1  Eligibility  In order to be entitled to the RSI, claimants who live alone must have a personal monthly income lower than €189.66. If they live with other people, the total monthly  2 It was only possible to obtain disaggregated data for mainland Portugal.  3 The IAS consists of a reference value used for calculating social benefits provided by the state. It started to be used in 2007. Previously, the reference used was the minimum wage.  According to its  regulatory  legal  framework , the IAS  is to be updated annually in line with selected macro economic indicators, namely the  effective change rate of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the effective growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) . Due to 2007 -2009 financial crisis , the IAS  adjustment mechanism was suspended, meaning that t here  was no regular updating of the IAS between 2009 and 2016 . The IAS amount   remained unchanged.  The IAS adjustment mechanism was re-established in 201 6, meaning that in 2016 the IAS  was  already updated under a “no policy change” general rule that took into account changes in the rate of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and of t he Gross Domestic Product (GDP) . After being updated in the following years, again it remained unchanged between 2020 and 2021  (€438.81) in consequence of the Covid -19 pandemic, but increased in  2022 (€443,20)   . Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  4  income of the household must be lower than the maximum amount of the RSI that would be calculated for that household. The maximum rate of the monthly benefit is €189.66 for claimants (100% of the RSI), €132.76 for each of the other adults in the household (70% of the RSI), and €94.83 for each child (50% of the RSI). Thus , in the case of a household composed of three adults and one child, the threshold is €550.01 (€189.66 + €132.76 + €132.76 + €94.83).  For the calculation of the total income of the household, only 80% of income from work after deduction of workers’ social security contributions is taken into account4. All household income , regardless of its nature and origin (thus also including other social benefits), is taken into account for the purposes of the means test. Both real property as such, and income derived from it, are taken into account. If household members own buildings for permanent residential purposes whose value exceeds 450 times the IAS, 5% of the difference between the value of the dwelling and the value of the IAS is taken into account. If households own other real property (not including the permanent residence), the highest of the following must be taken into account: i) the amount of rent; and ii) 5% of the net value of all the real property (not including the permanent residence).  The value of real property owned by claimants and their households cannot exceed 60 times the IAS. The proportion does not depend on the number of people in the households. The income of benefit claimants and their households is taken into account; the assets of their children aged below 18 are included in the calculation. The benefits  are not granted if the total value of assets exceeds 240 times the IAS. Both movable assets as such, and gross income from capital and from the realisation (sale or transfer) of movable assets, are taken into account. If household members have bank deposi ts, shares, savings certificates or other financial assets, the following amounts are deemed capital income: i) the value of the capital income (interest on bank deposits, share dividends or other income from other financial assets); and ii) 5% of the tota l value of movable assets (funds credited in bank accounts, shares, savings bonds or other financial assets).  The means test does not take into account income earned by students through holiday work, family benefits or disability and long -term care benefit s. If any household members start working after the application has been accepted, only 50% of work income (after contributions) will be considered.  Claimants must grant the Social Security Institute access to all the relevant information needed to assess their socio -economic position.  No information as to how the eligibility criteria were chosen is available.  The household income and assets taken into account when determining the benefit level have been tightened over time. Whereas in 2006 the income of th e previous month was considered, in 2010 the income of the previous calendar year was considered. In 2012 the limits on the amounts of real estate and assets taken into account were reduced. Another change regarded the proof of a non -marital partnership: i n 2006, it was necessary for applicants to have been in a non -marital partnership for a minimum period of one year, which in 2010 became two years. In 2012, eligibility for people from abroad was made more difficult, given the need to present residence cer tificates (entitlement to RSI is impossible if their situation is not regularised). In addition, the obligation to register at the employment centre (along with participation in training measures) was reinforced in 2012.  According to the legal framework of  May 2003, last revised in January 2019, the following criteria must be met: i) having legal residence in Portugal; ii) being in  4 Between July and December 2020, due to the pandemic situation, there was a change in the reference period used to calculate the benefits. The income considered became the income of the previous month before the claim, rather than the i ncome of the previous three months.

In order to prove their eligibility, claimants must present a set of documents (ID o r taxpayer card; photocopies of receipts of remuneration; and the certificate of registration of the right of residence issued by the city council). Third -country nationals have to show some additional documents (temporary stay visa, residence visa, tempor ary residence permit and permanent residence permit, which allow the assessment of the duration of residence for at least one year or; in the case of refugees, a residence permit with refugee status).  1.2  Coverage  According to a recent study, between 1998 and 2017 the RSI scheme covered 3.8% of the Portuguese population on average. The coverage varied over time. Between 1999 and 2001 and again between 2009 and 2011 it went above 4%. After 2013 it fell consistently to around 3%, reaching the lowest point in 2016  (2.8%) (GEP -MTSSS, 2021).  In 2021, according to statistics from the Social Security Institute, the scheme had 261,992  beneficiaries. This represented only slightly more than half of the number of beneficiaries reached at the peak, in March 2010, when it c overed 404,500 people, following steady increases after its creation.  The decrease relates, most of all, to the restricted access to the benefit imposed in the first half of the 2010s, primarily driven by the need to cut public expenditure as a means of t ackling the economic and financial crisis affecting the country.  The changes to the RSI programme led to the exclusion of a large number of beneficiaries, because of the stricter conditions for access. As put by Rodrigues, the reforms were “ an alteration that was needed, implemented at the worst possible moment due to the economic and financial crisis, and led mainly by the need to cut costs. The potential efficacy and efficiency gains that could be achieved were clearly eliminated by the intention to keep  unchanged the benchmarked values, leading instead to a reduction in the effectiveness of most benefits in alleviating poverty with minimum gains in terms of their efficiency ” (Rodrigues, 2011: 2).  A study by the Office for Strategy and Planning of the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security ( Gabinete de estratégia e planeamento do Ministério do Trabalho, Solidariedade e Segurança Social  – GEP -MTSSS) in 2021 emphasised that, as from 2010, not only did the RSI cover fewer of the population offi cially living in poverty (which was increasing), it also lost effectiveness in the coverage of the poorest (i.e. of those below 40% of the median equivalent income): “ Indeed, in 2010, 78% of this population was covered but there was a sharp decrease till 2 017 where the coverage rate stood at 37% [further adding that]  the decreased coverage is mostly due to the impact of the several legislative changes implemented over those years ” (GEP -MTSSS, 2021: 31 -32).  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  6  According to a microsimulation undertaken by Rodrig ues, the change in the RSI entitlement rules led to an increase in poverty intensity5 of about 30%, an increase in inequality as measured by the Gini co -efficient of 2%, and as measured by the Atkinson index (e = 2)6 of more than 9%, between 2009 and 201 3 (Rodrigues, 2013).  In June 2012 the reference value for the calculation of the benefit changed from the social pension to the IAS. On the same date, the OECD -modified equivalence scale became the reference for calculating the weight of household members.  Additionally, before the 2012 changes, the amount of the benefit could be increased in certain circumstances: for example, when households included people with severe mental or physical disabilities, or those with chronic diseases, or older people in a si tuation of great dependency; or to compensate for housing costs where these were higher than 25% of the RSI amount for the households concerned.  There are no data or estimates of the take -up of benefits, and few studies have attempted to analyse the issue.  However, the studies by Castro et al . (2012), Rodrigues et al . (2013) and Santos et al . (2014) provide some insights (Rodrigues et al., 2013: 43).  Santos et al . (2014) stress that even if no direct discrimination against specific groups regarding the access to the scheme was reported, some constraints could be identified, particularly affecting those most affected by social exclusion. Homeless people, for instance , face increased difficulties in accessing the measure due to lacking a fixed address. As a means of overcoming this situation, Article 2 of Order 253/2017, of 8 August, establishes that when applicants do not have a fixed address, they should choose the a ddress of an entity supporting them and close to the area where they usually stay for longer periods. Another constraint concerns the “complex procedures [that may act] as inhibitor factors in the access to the measure” (Santos et al ., 20014: 39). This is seconded by Rodrigues et al ., 2013, who indicate that “ new rules for new claims and renewals of the RSI may increase the bureaucratic process and create additional difficulties for families, leading to an increase in non -take -up” (Rodrigues et al., 2013: 2 6). In some cases, there is a need for tailored support from professionals who can act as intermediaries in relation the scheme, and help claimants to understand the procedures. However, even when support is available, take -up may be hampered, as “the lang uage used by some of the professionals is not appropriate to the characteristics of the groups of beneficiaries, impeding the professionals in playing their role of mediators effectively ” (Santos et al ., 2014: 40).  Yet another constraint concerns loss of p rivacy, because access to the benefit requires claimants to authorise RSI professionals to intrude into their lives, even into their homes, and to access information on their bank accounts. Linked to this is the social stigma associated with the measure, w hich even leads “ some respondents (most of all the unemployed) to refuse the possibility to benefit from the RSI as they wish to keep their distance from a measure that generates devaluation in terms of identity and public stigmatisation ” (Castro et al ., 2012: 263).  In October 2017, the Social Security Institute promoted an awareness -raising campaign on the RSI, aiming at “ providing dignity to the scheme, at highlighting its effectiveness as a measure for fighting poverty and social exclusion and at increas ing  5 Poverty intensity is measured as the difference between the median income of those with income below the at-risk -of-poverty threshold and the latter.  6 The Atkinson index is defined as the normalised ratio of the equal ly distributed equivalent level of income to the mean of the actual income distribution.   Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  7  its capacity for integration and inclusion ”7. The campaign ran in the second half of October 2017 and included spots on television and radio8, as well as posters9 in the press and on trains. It also included the creation of a phone line specifically  for providing information regarding the RSI. The aforementioned report by the GEP -MTSSS considers that this may have been a contributing factor in the increase in the number of beneficiaries of the scheme registered in 2017 (GEP -MTSSS, 2021: 36).  1.3  Adequac y The RSI is a differential benefit; that is, the monthly benefit corresponds to the difference between the maximum rate of the RSI and households’ total income. The amount of the RSI is defined in an order (i.e. a piece of legislation) issued by the Minis try of Solidarity and Social Security, and corresponds to a percentage of the IAS. The maximum rate of the monthly benefit is calculated in the following way: €189.66 for claimants (100% of the reference value); €132.76 for other adults in the household (7 0% of the reference value); and €94.83 for every child in the household (50% of the reference value).   Amount  % at -risk -of-poverty threshold  % extreme at-risk -of-poverty threshold (40% of median)  % minimum wage  single  person  €189.66  34.2  39.5 41.8  44.0  46.0   51.3  59.2  62.7  66.0  69.0   29.9  single  person with 1 child  €284.49  44.8 couple with 1 child  €417.25  65.7 couple with 2 children  €512.08  80.6  3 adults and 3 children  €739.67  116.5  Notes: (a) the at-risk -of-poverty threshold was € 6.653  per year or € 554,41 per month in 2020 ; (b) the minimum wage was € 635 per month in 2020 . The amounts of the benefit are very low. Rather than fighting poverty, the benefit is aimed at mitigating its intensity and severity, as acknowledged by different authors and studies (e.g. Rodrigues et al ., 2016; GEP -MTSSS, 2021) and also by the European Commission (EC) in its latest country reports for Portugal.  GEP -MTSSS (2021) concluded that: i) the RSI does have a positive impact, but the amount of the benefit is too low and the investment in social inclusion is insufficient; ii) it tackles the severity  of poverty but struggles to promote the autonomy of beneficiaries; and iii) access to employment is an aspiration of most beneficiaries but they feel discrimination and stigmatisation as obstacles.  As acknowledged by the EC, “ the adequacy of the minimum i ncome scheme is among the lowest in the Union, providing incomes of only 40% of the national poverty threshold ” (EC, 2020b: 6) which “(…) does not allow to escape poverty. The adequacy of the minimum income support is well below the EU average ” (EC, 2020a:  43).   7 News available at: https://www.seg -social.pt/noticias/ -/asset_publisher/kBZtOMZgstp3/content/campanha -de-divulgacao -do-rendimento -social -de-insercao . 8 Available at: https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc21/comunicacao/multimedia?m=v&i=campanha -de-divulgacao -do-rsi.   9 Available at: https://www.seg -social. pt/documents/10152/13308/Cartaz_RSI_2017/8ae659f7 -86fd -447b -8631 -3febc9ca3ed  and at https://www.seg -social.pt/documents/10152/13308/Mono folha_RSI_2017/0b661638 -1a90 -4373 -a667 -ea0c397bf7d2 . Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  8  Article 16 of Law 123/2021 , December 30th, requires beneficiaries to apply for the social benefits to which they are entitled, as well as to demand the right to credit or payment of maintenance. Also, according to Article 21, beneficiaries must notif y the managing entities (Social Security Institute or protocol teams) when there are changes within 10 days. For that reason, the level of the benefit may be reviewed at all times, namely whenever there is a change regarding the income or the composition of households.  The RSI is awarded for a maximum period of 12 months, but it may be renewed for equal periods and as long as eligibility conditions are met.  If there are changes to the requirements for eligibility, the benefit may be adjusted, suspended or c ancelled. The benefit can be reviewed at any time if the make -up and income of households change.  No data on waiting times (for payment) are available. There are no provisions for early payment (even before approval of the application) in case of particula r need. In such cases, the resort available is discretionary social action.  There is no fixed frequency for indexing/uprating the benefit. The amount of the RSI is defined in an order (i.e. a piece of legislation) issued by the Ministry of Solidarity and Social Security and corresponds to a percentage of the IAS. In 202 2, the IAS was set at € 443,20 . The latest change was in Order  nº 22/2019, of 17 January, which established the monthly amount of the RSI for a single person at €189.66.  1.4  Links with other benef its The RSI may be cumulated with other benefits, namely: social old -age pension; social invalidity pension; widow’s pension; orphan’s pension; dependence supplement; solidarity complement for the elderly; rent subsidy; disability bonus; allowance for atte ndance to a third person; allowance for attendance at a special school; family allowance; prenatal allowance; parenthood and adoption benefit; sickness benefit; unemployment benefit; and unemployment allowance.  However, the eligibility criteria should cont inue to be met; that is, the total monthly income of households must be lower than the maximum RSI amount that would be calculated for them (e.g. €189.66 if claimants live alone). This means that, in practice, receiving another benefit may imply not being eligible for the RSI. Given the differential character of the RSI, even if individuals or households are eligible, the amount received will be reduced.  Other benefits that RSI recipients may receive include: social housing, the social tariff for water and for wastewater collection and treatment ; social energy tariff ; exemption from healthcare user charges; and reduced fares for public transport.  The legal framework for the social tariff for water and for wastewater collection and treatment is defined at nat ional level by Decree -Law nº 147/2017, of 5 December. According to this, eligibility is granted to people in situations of economic vulnerability. These are understood as households with an annual income equal to or lower than €5,808 (plus 50% for each mem ber without income, up to a maximum of 10), or where the contract -holder is in receipt of any of the benefits included in a list, including the RSI.  Assistance with energy costs consists of lower prices for gas and electricity, and of extraordinary social support for energy consumers (ASECE). These measures reduce the cost of energy consumption. In addition, RSI recipients are exempted from paying the special tax on electricity consumption. Eligibility rules applying to electricity are equally applicable to  water.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  9  In March 202 2, there were 762,320  beneficiaries of the social tariff for electricity and  49,822  beneficiaries of the social tariff for gas, according to statistics10 available.  Beneficiaries with insufficient means (household members with average monthly earnings of at most 1.5 times the value of the IAS) and dependent household members are exempt from paying healthcare user charges. The exemption must be applied for, and is not exclusive to RSI beneficiaries.  According to the latest figures available, a total of 2,361,247 people (around 22% of the population) were exempted from healthcare charges for reasons of economic vulnerability in August 2021.  The reduced fares for public transport relate to monthly passes only; there are no reductions for individual tickets. Beneficiaries of RSI, along with others on low income, are eligible for a price reduction of 50% of the “passe social+”, which exists only in the metropolitan areas of  Lisbon and Porto.  Children and young recipients of the RSI are also eligible for 60% reductions of the “ 4_18@escola.tp ” and “ sub23@superior.tp ” monthly passes.  Overall, the support provided by these measures should  be deemed important for meeting the needs of RSI recipients (as well as of other vulnerable people) as it facilitates access by those living with very low monthly incomes to healthcare and other essential services.  2
