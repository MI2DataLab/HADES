Governance mechanisms  Since 1 March 2015, decisions on MI schemes are made at national level, with delivery implemented by district -level government authorities ( járási kormányhivatalok ). Some linked benefits (e. g. the local benefit, települési támogatás)  are regulated by local governments, as well as at national level. Applications for social provisions in cash and in kind are submitted to the local government where the applicant officially resides and the releva nt district (either the járás  – an entity smaller than the county level, or the kerület  - a district of Budapest). Applications for the benefit for people of active age are submitted to the PES where the client is registered, and the PES then forwards the application to the relevant district office. The benefit for persons in active age is tax-financed from the central budget.   17 https://kozfoglalkoztatas.kormany.hu/download/6/25/d2000/Havi%20jelent%C3%A9s_2021_aug_%28p ort%C3%A1l%29.pdf   18 Interviews with the PES and NGO representatives.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in t he effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  17  Although data are available, there is no regular monitoring. The follow -up inspection process is carried out monthly, but only for the beneficiaries of ALMPs. For jobseekers in receipt of the ESB, there is no follow -up, except where they are participating in an ALMP. Data are collected in suitably structured databases, with individual records linked across sources, but are used only b y the benefit paying agency to administer support payments.  The district office has the power to review and monitor for fraud. Such reviews (e.g. annually for the ESB) consist of the authorities requiring clients to complete a form and attach proof of at l east 30 days’ work in the last 12 months. The benefit is then extended for another year. Authorities may request account information from the bank and they also may check the land registry for property ownership. A certificate of value of the property can be requested from the  tax authority . There is no information as to whether they do this in all cases or randomly. The regulations also allow them to check the social benefits register to determine if a person receives benefits from elsewhere, or they may a sk the National Tax Authority for these data. Fraudulent cases may also come to light during inspections by the labour inspection authorities. The possibility to appeal to the government office against an administrative decision of a district office was ab olished two years ago, with revoke/refund decisions now only challenged directly in the administrative court within 30 days of the decision. According to an NGO representative providing legal services for the most disadvantaged people, appeals made little sense as it was very rare for the government office to reverse the decision of a district office. Although appeals to the courts are free of charge, the extremely technical nature of the application form makes it is extremely difficult for the person conce rned to submit an application that the court will accept or indeed to give good reasons why they should receive the benefit. Social service providers should be involved formally in the service provision for MIS recipients. There is no regular, systematic m onitoring and evaluation, although data are available, if not publicly.   5
