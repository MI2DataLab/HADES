Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  The Social Welfare Act define s different social rights , including the ‘ Guaranteed Minimum Benefit ’ (GMB), which is granted to a Croatian citizen who is resident in Croatia , and to a foreigner or stateless person with permanent residence in Croatia. Foreigners under subsidiary protection or who have a n established status of a victim of human trafficking , as well as asylum  seekers  and their family members legally residing  in the country,  are granted social welfare rights under the conditions prescribed by th e Social Welfare Act and by a special regulation.  According to the Social Welfare Act , the GMB  is the monetary amount that should ensure the fulfilment of basic needs of a person or a household. The Act does not provide a definition of basic needs. Beneficiaries of the GMB are single persons or families forming one household who do not have e nough financial resources for the basic means of life. For a one -member household , the base for GMB is HRK 800 ( EUR 106) a month. Depending on household composition , those who have insufficient income from work, property income, or from the person liable t o pay support (if the welfare centre establishes that the person concerned is not able to provide support) are eligible to receive the balance of this base.  The amount receiv ed thus  varies according to the composition of the household and the claimant’s (h ousehold) income. The base amount of HRK 800 ( EUR 106) used to calculate the GMB was established by Government Decision. Household GMB cannot exceed the gross minimum wage. In 2021, the gross minimum wage amounted to HRK 4  250 ( EUR 563) per month, which is determined annually by Government Decision.  Total annual expenditure on financing GMB benefits depends on the number of beneficiaries , with expenditure totalling HRK 388.4 million (around EUR 52 million)  in 2020, HRK 20 .8 million  (around EUR 56 million) in 2019, and HRK 484 .8 million (around EUR  65 million ) in 2018. It represents less than 1% of total social protection expenditure in Croatia , according to the Croatian Bureau of Statistics.  1.1  Eligibility  Those capable of work ing must be registe red with  the Croatian Employment Service and must actively seek a job  and must  accept any job offer , regardless of their qualifications or experience, including temporary and seasonal jobs. If beneficiaries of GMB refuse a job offer or terminate their empl oyment, their right to GMB can be suspended for six months.  Residence:  Permanent residence is required, with temporary residence accepted  in exceptional circumstances . Citizenship is required, but foreign nationals with residence permits are entitled to b enefits in accordance with the applicable treaties. Beneficiaries of international protection and their family members legally residing in Croatia are entitled to social welfare according to the provisions of the Social Welfare Act (Official Gazette No 157 /13, 152/14 and 99/15). No age requirements  are applied .  Income test: Household disposable income earned in the three months before the claim is taken into account , including income from work, property or social benefits. The i ncome test is stipulated by Article 30 of Social Welfare Act. The GMB amount for a single person capable of taking up work shall be 100% of the basic amount  stipulated by Article 27  of the Soc ial Welfare Act  (HRK 800 / EUR  106), whereas for a  household it shall be established by summing up income shares for each household member as defined by the Social Welfare Act (see Section 1.3). If a single person or a household accumulates income, the GMB amount shall be established as the difference between the GMB amount (base amount HRK 800 / EUR 106) and the average monthly income of the single person or household accumulation in the three months prior to the month claiming the benefit. A number of sourc es of income are not taken into account in the means -testing of GMB. These include housing allowance, fuel allowance, disability allowance, care allowance, personal disability allowance, child Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  2  support, and social benefits from regional or local government.  For example: a person fit for work earned a wage of HRK 400 (EUR 53)  last month  and is entitled t o the fuel allowance of HRK 200 and housing allowance of HRK 200 ( neither included in the means test ), thus they will receive GMB of HRK 400 for this month. Their t otal disposable income was HRK 400 +  HRK 400 GMB + HRK 200  fuel + HRK 200  housing  = HRK 1 200. However, the 2020 poverty threshold was HRK 2 900 ( at risk of poverty (AROP) rate: 60% of median disposable income).  Asset test:  People  are not eligible for GMB if they own a second residence that brings in income, or if they have sold a property within three years prior to their  claim. The Social Welfare Act does not set a specific value for th at second property. If an owned property coul d be used to generate income through rental or sale, without compromising basic needs, then a person or household will be deemed ineligible. In some cases, inheritance of worthless real estate could be grounds for a person’s non -eligibility for GMB.  Genera lly, claimants cannot possess a registered vehicle, except in cases of disability, old age or limited mobility. This criterion for exclusion from the GMB  seems both strict  and problematic in take -up of the scheme.  After widespread media attention1, the ne w Social Welfare Act2 (planned to enter the Parliament procedure by the end of 2021) proposed setting a car value above  HRK 20  000 (EUR 3  000) in the means test procedure.  No measures sought to  simplify or facilitate access to GMB or other social benefits  during the COVID -19 crisis in Croatia  (Šućur and Babić, 2021).  1.2  Coverage  The Ministry for Labour, Pension System, Family and Social Policy  (MLPSFSP)  report ed that the re were 57  335 GMB beneficiaries in 2020 , approximately 1.5% of the country’s population ( compared to 62 301 in 2019 and 72  159 in 2018 ). T he share of those over 65 years of age remained around 12%3. Eurostat estimates for Croatia put the extreme poverty rate (40% of median  disposable equivalised  income) at 7.3% in 2020, 7 .2% in 2019 , and 8.3% in 2018, while the AROP rate for relative poverty (60% of median) was 18.3% in 2020 and 2019, and 19.3% in 2018.  This relatively low coverage  is explained by the stringent means -test criteria described above, and the low benefit level. T he benefit level was determined by a relatively low base (HRK 800 / EUR  106) in 2014 without indexation, excluding many poor people from the  GMB scheme. Between 2014  and 2021 , the AROP threshold of relat ive poverty for a one -person  household increased from HRK 2 000 (EUR  266) to HRK 2 930 ( EUR 390) , decreasing the poverty threshold coverage of the GMB from 40% in 2014 to 27% in 2020.  No data are available on the non -take -up rate in Croatia  and t he M LPSFSP  has not undertaken any research in this area.    1 https://slobodnadalmacija.hr/vijesti/hrvat ska/ministarstvo -ukida -sve -obiteljske -domove -znacajno -se-dizu -i-iznosi -socijalne -pomoci -za-pojedine -kategorije -osoba -evo -tko-sve -moze -ostvariti -pravo -1132779   2 https://vlada.gov.hr/UserDocsImages//2016/Sjednice/2015/245%20sjednica%20Vlade//Prijedlog%20zakona%20o%20izmjenama%20i%20do punama%20Zakona%20o%20socijalnoj%20skrbi,%20s%20Kona%C4%8Dnim%20prijedlogom%20zakona.pdf   3 https://mrosp.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/Socijalna%20politika/Odluke/Godisnje%20statisticko%20 izvjesce%20u%20RH%20za%202020.%20godinu.PDF   Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  3  1.3  Adequacy  The Croatian minimum income system , represented by the GMB , has serious shortcomings in respect of its adequacy . The value of the GMB depends on a 2014 Government Decision that set it at  HRK  800 ( EUR 106)4, without any refe rence budge t to set the level of benefit. One EU-wide research study5 established that  in Croatia,  the monthly budget required for a healthy diet ( including kitchen equipment ) in March 2015 was EUR 166 (HRK 1  269.58) for a single person and EUR 564 (HRK 4  313.53) for a family of two adults and two children. According to the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, the at -risk -of-poverty -and -exclusion ( AROPE ) threshold for one person living alone was around EUR 280 (HRK 2  183) monthly in 2015. A  single adult living alone receives around EUR 106 in monthly GMB, which w as not enough to cover  healthy food expenses in 2015, and  it reached only 38% of the poverty threshold that year . The situation is worse for a family of two a dults and two children , which receives around EUR 215  GMB  monthly  (excluding other social benefits) , despite needing EUR 564 to cover healthy food expenses alone  (rates 2015) .   The stringent  means test procedure can result in exclusion of  the poor  from th e right to GMB ( e.g. having a car c an render a person ineligible for the GMB) . The calculation base of the guaranteed minimum benefit has remained at HRK  800 ( EUR 106) since being set by Government Decision in 2014. A one -off allowance of up to HRK 2  500 (EUR 330) for a single person can be approved once a year in cases of sudden difficulties in meeting basic needs. The Social Welfare Act does not provide more specific criteria , leaving the types of need to the  discretion of the social case workers in CSWs.   The amount of the GMB  is determined as a percentage of the base , as follows:   Single person incapable of work: 115%, (HRK  920, EUR  122);   Single  person capable of work: 100%, (HRK 800, EUR 106);   Adult househo ld member: 60%, (HRK  480, EUR 64);   Child: 40%, (HRK 320, EUR  42);  Child of a lone parent: 55%  (HRK  440, EUR 59);  If a single person or a household generates income, the amount of the GMB is the difference between the amount of the minimum benefit  and the average monthly income in the previous three months. The amount of the benefit for one household shall not exceed the gross minimum wage as determined annually by government decision ( HRK 4 250 ( EUR 563)  in 2021);  ‘Social benefits ceiling ’ - this rule sets the maximum social benefits accumulation in one household, which cannot exceed the gross minimum wage .  There is no i ndexation of GMB benefits and the base has remained unchanged since 2014. However, the MLPSFSP has suggested that forthcoming social welfare reform  will see the base increased to HRK 1  000 ( EUR 133) in 2022.  Again, h owever, there seems to be no underlying method or calculation basis for the increase.  1.4  Links with other benef its Rights to GMB function as a ‘passport’ to other benefits , such as one -off allowance s, housing benefits, fuel allowance , or benefit for energy buyers at risk. A one-off allowance can be approved each year in cases of sudden difficulties in meeting basic needs , arising from the birth or education of a child, illness or death of a family  4 https://narodne -novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2014_09_114_2172.html   5 Eur opean Commission (2015) .
