Links to social services and integrated provision of targeted social services  Policies to promote the social inclusion of GMI beneficiaries (Pillar 2) were provided since the inception of the scheme. From mid -2021, such policies began to be systema tically recorded by municipal services and community centres  in the Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  9  framework of the procedure launched in June 2021 for the interconnection of GMI beneficiaries with the 2nd and 3rd pillar . More specifically:   At the time of applying for the GMI, municipal or community centre employees handling the application inform claimants of the possibility to claim other benefits, services and goods, provided they meet the relevant eligibility conditions in each case;   If not submit an application through the municipal or community centers, GMI beneficiaries and their dependents are later invited to visit the municipality or community centre, where they are advised or referred to suitable supplementary social services at local or national level. Referrals are m onitored by the case manager responsible for assessing the needs of the recipient household, on the basis of which a Personal/F amily Social Empowerment Plan is then drawn up.  Unlike the ‘profiling’ for an Individual Action Plan under Pillar 3, there is no  specific questionnaire for needs assessment for a  Personal/Family Social Empowerment Plan under Pillar 2.  The lack of integration between the different platforms used to assess  applications and provision of social benefits, services and goods  remains a key  challenge . The Ministry’s monitoring report (2021) provides information on the number of GMI recipients being briefed  on Pillar 2 additional benefits, services, and goods by municipality or community centre staff on a monthly basis. The numbers appear  low: in September 2021, out of a total 231  395 households (426  637 members), 3 078 were invited to a briefing session on additional benefits, services, and goods, of which 1 838 attended . Data on actual receipt of Pillar 2 additional benefits, services, and goods by GMI recipients are not yet available.  4
