Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  2  time to time for selected programmes/schemes. The most recent impact assessment is promising in that some of the secondary benefits that the recipients of SWA and JA might be entitled to reduce deprivation.  From the evidence considered here, it can be suggested that the minimum income benefit level for the households with the greatest risks be prioritised  further  for uprating – namely, households with (especially older) children and working -age households headed by one adult  (there is some moveme nt in that respect – recent budgets have increased rates for child dependents and in particular older children ). A second recommendation would be for a systematic process to assess the adequacy of these and other benefits and services on a regular basis an d that the decisions around whether and when to uprate the benefit levels should be made on the basis of the evidence from this process overall.  The following sections, first, outline the features of the MI support in place; secondly, describe the eligibil ity criteria and coverage and consider  the adequacy of the financial support provided and the links with other benefits; thirdly, examine the extent of integration with labour market measures to help those supported into employment; fourthly, consider the  access provided for the people concerned to social services; fifthly, summarise the governance mechanisms in place; and, finally, review the evidence on the impact on reducing poverty and assisting beneficiaries to find work.  An annex outlines the underlying situation in terms of the relative number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion and the changes that have occurred over recent years, as well as the characteristics of the people concerned – their gender, age, employment status, educa tion level, country of birth and the structure of the households in which they live. As such, it provides the context in which MI support is operating and indicates the groups on which support needs to be targeted.  1 Description of national schemes providing  minimum income support3  Minimum income provision in Ireland is complex, consisting of a range of different programmes for different population categories. Hence, as well as a general scheme of last resort, particular sectors of the population of working  age for which targeted minimum income programmes exist include: the unemployed, lone parents, those who are ill or disabled, and carers. In practice then, minimum income provision in Ireland serves a diverse set of needs and also quite a diverse populatio n. The trend has been towards rationalisation but from a minimum income perspective categorical provision is still the norm. Within this complex and fragmented system of minimum income provision in Ireland, in this report two main schemes will be analysed:  the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) as the key minimum income scheme of last resort and the Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) as the main non -contributory allowance for people of working age4.  In Table 1 the total expenditure for the programmes is presen ted.  Table 1.

It is divided into two main parts. The first is a basic weekly allowance for eligible people who have little or no income or whose weekly inco me is below a threshold considered basic; the second is assistance to people with low incomes who may qualify for a weekly supplement to meet special regular needs (such as housing or fuel related costs) or help in an emergency or with exceptional needs (t hese are listed under related payments – information here relates to the ‘basic’ allowance ). The basic payment cannot be combined with other core payments  such as Jobseekers Allowance  – it is often paid on a short -term basis until people have their applica tion for one of the other programmes processed. The payment is regarded as a social advantage for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Reg 492/2011 (Free Movement of Workers). Under these regulations those who retain workers status are exempt from satisfying th e Habitual Residence Condition when claiming this payment. Those who have been in employment here, even for short periods, can qualify for Supplementary Welfare Allowance without the need to satisfy HRC. Where the employment lasts for less than 12 months, that entitlement exists for up to six months, i.e. for as long as the person retains worker status under the residence provisions .  Eligibility depends on means, residence and work conditions.   Means : Claimants must satisfy a test of means. This means that their income needs to be below the basic SWA rate (see 1.3 Adequacy). There is a one -to-one income test that reduces the benefit by the entirety of net family income5. The main items taken into account  for the means test are all cash income and the value of ‘benefit and privilege’ for those aged 24 years or younger who are living with a parent. It relates only to the resources of immediate household. The first €5,000 of the value of capital or investmen t (other than the family home which is not taken into account) is disregarded for the purposes of means assessment6.  Residence : Entitlement is conditional on satisfying habitual residence conditions, which includes the requirement that a person is legally  resident in the State7 for the purposes of entitlement to social assistance and  have a close link to the state . There are no additional local or regional residence requirements.   5 Including Jobseeker’s Benefit, Jobseek er’s Allowance, Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment, One -Parent Family Payment and Working Family Payment; Child Benefit is excluded from the means test.  6 Full details of the means test for JA are available at https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html   7 EU/EEA  and Swiss migrant workers who have been working in Ireland can access basic SWA and supplements without having  habitual residence assessed , provided they have the right to reside in Ireland. However, people from the E U/EEA or Switzerland who move to Ireland in search of employment are subject to the habitual residence test in the normal way while looking for work.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  4   Work : In order to qualify for SWA, a working age person must be registered f or work with their local Intreo (Ireland’s national Public Employment Service agency) office. Those who are in employment for more than 30 hours a week or in full -time education are not normally considered to qualify. Therefore the recipients must be activ ely looking for work; registered with the public employment services; have signed an integration contract or employment plan; participate in activation measures, such as training or job experience programmes.  Jobseeker’s Allowance:  JA is the main non -contr ibutory allowance for people of working age. To qualify, a person must   be habitually resident in Ireland (explained above);   be fully unemployed (or work for 3 days a week or less), available and capable for and genuinely seeking work;   aged over 18 and un der 66 years (below the statutory retirement age);   satisfy a means test. The means test examines the following types of income: cash income (including income from work), property personally used, capital (savings and investments) and property not personall y used, benefit and privilege from living with parents8. The resulting total household means is deducted from the relevant maximum rate for recipients to find the actual amount of Jobseeker’s Allowance they are entitled to.  1.2  Coverage  There is no direct mea sure of coverage since the population in need is not known. Table 2 shows the number of recipients of SWA and JA for the last 3 years for which data is available.  Table 2.  Number of recipients of SWA and JA, 2018 -2020  MI scheme  2018  2019  2020  Supplementary Welfare Allowance  16,269  15,779  11,747  Jobseeker’s Allowance  140,337  123,633  125,703  Source: Department of Social Protection 2021  In terms of problems associated with the coverage of relevant vulnerable populations, the 'Habitual Residence Condition' mentioned in the previous section raises concerns about access to benefits for certain groups. Asylum seekers are among the groups that  are particularly affected by this as they do not satisfy habitual residence conditions and accordingly are not eligible for the general schemes  such as JA and the Basic payment under SWA .  They are supported under an alternative system, where their housin g and food are provided directly, they receive a weekly cash allowance (€38.80 per adult and €29.80 per child) and, where this is insufficient, receive Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP) and Urgent Needs Payments (UNP)  under the SWA scheme9.    8 Full details of the means test for JA are available at https://www.citizensinfo rmation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test_for_jobseekers_allowance.html   9 Following the publication of the white paper on ending Direct Provision in February 2021, plans are in place to prov ide a minimum income payment to these applicants who have been waiting more than 4 months for a decision on their application for international protection and choose to live independently in the community.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  5  There are two  other problems reported regarding eligibility for SWA. One points to the 'discretionary element' of this benefit. The Irish Minimum Income Network (2014) notes that the uncertainty involved in the application process acts as a barrier for some people who think they will not be eligible anyway. Another, and related, problem is about the appeal process. Ireland Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) (2017) raises concerns about the length of this process that might take as much as 5 months, resulting i n the exclusion of potentially eligible people. There is evidence that the certain requirements create problems also for homeless people, such as difficulties with getting payments due to not having a permanent address or not being able to prove residing i n a relevant social welfare catchment area (The Irish Times 2020).  In order to minimise this problem, the Department provides a  c/o address to homeless claimants10. Given that the minimum income programmes are all based on a means -test, the re is a risk of  non -take up. However, no recent information exists on non -take up of the minimum income benefits which are the focus of this report. In terms of attempting to increase take -up of minimum income benefits, a range of the usual strategies are utilised on a pe riodic basis. These focus especially on information campaigns through a variety of media and formats, using both remote and face -to-face methods.  1.3  Adequacy  There is no direct measure of adequacy of the benefit level and no official procedures exist to asse ss the adequacy of minimum income or other benefits. The underlying rationale of setting the benefit levels goes back to some 30 years ago when there was a Commission on Social Welfare to investigate the issues in Irish social welfare system. Here the logi c was that the payment level needed to be ‘adequate in relation to prevailing living standards’. The arbitrary nature and difficulty of setting a standard for adequacy was acknowledged, but a ‘£50 -60 per week’ range for a single person was estimated by usi ng several indicators. There is also a scarcity of evidence on the adequacy of minimum income provisions. In this context, it is helpful to consider the comparison of minimum income benefit levels with poverty thresholds and also minimum income sufficiency  standards.  In regard to national median income, the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) 2019 (the latest available) yielded a nominal median income of €43,552 a year and an equivalised disposable nominal income of €23,979. The nominal at risk o f poverty threshold (i.e. 60% of the median) for one adult and no children stood at €14,387; the real value, i.e. at 2012 prices, of the at risk of poverty threshold for 2019 was €14,047 and this represents an increase of 4.0% on the real value for 2018 of €13,505 (Central Statistics Office 2021). The threshold for a household consisting of two adults and two children was €33,378 (compared with €31,837 a year earlier). Table 3 and 4 below show the level of income support provided by SWA and JA and Table 5 s hows the relativities between the payment rates of SWA for the different household types and a number of benchmarks.

Rates may be varied by Government as part of the annual Budget process. During the pandemic, SWA recipients whose employment or family situation had changed due to COVID -19 could ask for the status to be reassessed (and their payment potentially recalculat ed) by the Social Protection Office. Re the JA and unemployed people; a special Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) of €203, €250, €300 or €350 per week (depending on the categorisation of prior weekly earnings) was introduced in 2020 and is being phased o ut by spring 202211. This payment is compatible with other welfare payments.  It can be observed from Table 5 that the level of benefits seems somewhat adequate for the selected 40% threshold but clearly falls short of a minimum standard if one looks at the  other threshold set at 60%. Beyond these benchmarks, it is useful to look at the work on Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL) in Ireland that has been researched and calculated by a faith -based NGO (Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice). This is derived using the Consensual Budget Standards methodology through which detailed baskets of over 2,000 goods and services for 16 areas of expenditure vital to a household’s minimum needs are compiled for a number of different types of households12. The evidence on JA reveals inadequacies, although the extent to which this is the case will be different for different household compositions. In their MESL 2021 Annual Update, the NGO examines social welfare adequacy with an evaluation of 214 test urban house hold cases (Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice 2021a). Of these, 147 were ‘inadequate’ cases in 2021. Some household examples are shown in Table 6. Income adequacy seems to be an even bigger issue for those living in rural  11 https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/covid19_pandemic_unemployment_payment.html  12 Focus groups are held for each h ousehold type. In a series of sessions the groups arrive at a negotiated consensus about the goods and services a household requires to have a minimum essential standard of living. Experts are consulted in order to ensure that the negotiated consensus meet s basic criteria e.g. nutritional standards. In order to ensure reliability and validity three different focus groups are established for each household type.

For example, for the two adults with one infant urban household (third type in Table 6), the inadequate amount increases from €13.70 to €62.31 for the equivalent rural household.  Table 6.

Household members have full medical cards. For details of the calculations please see https://www.budgeting.ie/urban -budgets/income -scenario s.html .  Regarding the poverty reduction potential of the benefits  – there is evidence from the Central Statistics Office ( n.d. ) showing that i n 2020, if all social transfers were excluded from income, the at risk of poverty rate would have gone up from  the actual  13.2% to 37.9% . But this data include many other benefits that ar e irrelevant here (e.g. old -age benefits, disability benefits etc.) . Apart from the this, t here are two (relatively) recent impact assessments to note here  that have a more detailed analysis . Although not directly evaluating the specific MI schemes examined in this report (SWA and JA), these benefits are at least partially included in their analysis, and this currently is the only evidence available.  The first one is Watson and Maître (2013). Using Irish SILC data, the authors consider the impact of transfers on the difference between market income and the poverty threshold (note that this was on all social transfers rather than just minimum income schemes). The evidence showed that this period was marked by the increasing importance of transfer income to Irish households, with notable changes especially in transfer income as  a proportion of total income. The causal process at work here was two -fold: increasing payment rates for social transfers between 2004 and 2009 and a shift in the type of payment received (especially as the economic crisis set in). This research generally  highlighted the effectiveness of Irish social transfers, in their own right and in terms of improvement over time. The report indicated that social transfers reduced the pre -transfer poverty rate by 53% in 2004, rising to 63% by 2007 and 71% by 2011 (Wats on and Maître 2013: 37). The main causal factor was the increasing generosity of transfer payments over the period studied, especially means -tested transfers. While greatest improvements in poverty reduction were recorded for those of retirement age, with a 95% effectiveness rate (compared to 84% for Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  9  working -age adults), the biggest percentage (relative) improvement in poverty reduction effectiveness since 2004 was for children (20% improvement).  The second, and the more recent one, is Maître et al. (2020).  Again drawing on Ireland’s Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) using the 2017 wave, the authors evaluate the association between material deprivation and social transfer receipt in the areas of housing, medical cards and childcare. Information o n benefit receipt is gathered from administrative sources using participants’ Personal Public Service number (as opposed to self -report). Among the transfers they study, most of the ones under housing payments are the supplementary benefits that can be rec eived by SWA and/or JA recipients if they fulfil any additional eligibility criteria that might exist: Rent Allowance, Rent Supplement, Mortgage Interest Supplement, Exceptional Needs Payments and Heat Supplement (measured together), plus a second set of housing -related allowances such as Fuel Allowance – all of which were described under the section 1.4 below. When the effects of housing transfer on deprivation are simulated, it is seen that transfers reduce deprivation – receipt of housing transfers incre ases the odds of experiencing no deprivation by 1.48 percentage points. Furthermore, vulnerable groups, such as lone parents and people living with a person with a disability, report the highest benefit from housing transfers when compared to other working -age adults. Whereas the authors note that observed effects here are rather marginal, the impact of the more recent schemes such as HAP, which have emerged to fill the gap in the private rental sector, was not evaluated here. As these payments helped recip ients with the increasing housing costs, the actual impact today is likely to be bigger.  Overall, from the evidence considered here one can see the potential of SWA and JA in terms of poverty reduction; but the inadequacy of the payment rates especially fo r certain household types (and an even bigger inadequacy for the same household types in rural Ireland)  means that even further poverty reduction can be achieved with higher rates. It can be suggested that the minimum income benefit level for the househol ds with the greatest risks be prioritised for uprating – namely, households with (especially older) children13 and working -age households headed by one adult  (there is some movement in that respect – recent budgets have increased rates for child dependents  and in particular older children). . A second recommendation would be for a systematic process to assess the adequacy of these and other benefits and services on a regular basis and that the decisions around whether and when to uprate the benefit levels sh ould be made on the basis of the evidence from this process overall. In other words, the benchmark should be adequacy. The Department of Social Protection should  continue to  engage with the work done by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice on the MESL and other NGO activities (for example around an adequate minimum wage by the Living Wage Technical Group14) for this purpose.  1.4  Links with other benefits  Under the second part of the SWA those receiving the benefit – and anyone who can demonstrate need (by putting in a separate application) even if on other benefits - can be eligible for a range of means -tested and discretionary assistance. These schemes relate to: rent, heating, back to school clothing and footwear, exceptional needs and urgent needs.  Rent Supplement is a payment to those on social welfare schemes (not just social assistance schemes) to contribute towards rental payments in the private rented sector. Recipients of minimum -income payments must contribute towards their weekly  13 The increased costs asociated  with older children not being matched by a sufficient increase in benefit.  14 See https://www.livingwage.ie   Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  10  rental paymen ts from their income: €30 a week for individuals and €40 a week for a couple – therefore these amounts are reduced from the rent supplement payment. Since 2014 a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) has existed for those with long -term housing needs which:  a) transfers the support responsibility for this sector of the housing -need population from the Department of Social Protection to the local authorities and b) bases housing assistance on the local authority differential rent means test. The significance of this is that under the latter the full -time employment restriction does not apply, therefore removing a key barrier to benefit recipients taking up employment15.  A Fuel Allowance may be paid to help with the cost of home heating. The purpose of this pa yment is to assist these households with their energy costs.   The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household  – it is not intended to meet those costs in full.   Only one allowance is paid per household.  To be eligible, JA r ecipients must have been receiving their allowance for 390 days – for SWA recipients this period is 455 days16. Also, a Heating Supplement may be paid in respect of exceptional heating needs (e.g. exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a  medical condition) where the claimant satisfies general conditions of entitlement to SWA. In order to qualify a claimant must live alone or only with an adult or child who qualifies for a payment.  The Back to School  Clothing and Footwear Allowance is a once a year payment to parents of school going children who are either on certain social welfare payments or in training or education.  Exceptional Needs Payment is a discretionary usually once -off payment to meet unusu al circumstances. The examples given in the official documentation include items such as special clothing in the case of a person who has a serious illness, bedding or cooking utensils for someone setting up a home for the first time, costs in relation to funerals, visiting relatives in hospital or prison.  Urgent Needs Payment is a single payment to help meet essential, once -off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. The examples given i n the documentation include costs arising from a fire or flood.  2
