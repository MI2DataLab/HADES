Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  1  Summary  The interpretation of adequacy depends on whether we look at the level of a single benefit or the level of the combined minimum income basket. Furthermore, family type and life situation have an impact on the results. When the  total income basket consisting of different forms of minimum benefits  is taken into consideration , the Finnish levels of minimum income protection are either in the middle or close to the top among EU Member States. According to Eurostat, Finnish income transfers effectively reduce the risk of poverty and, consequently , poverty rates in Finland are among the lowest in the EU.  The receipt of different forms of MI security benefits in Finland is more parallel than sequential (i.e. benefits are often paid on top of one another, and complement one another). This is the case with the labour market subsidy (LMS), h ousing allowance, and social assistance. These three forms of basic/minimum security benefits are strongly intertwined. For example,  62% of the persons receiving minimum unemployment benefits received  housing allowance, social assistance  or both of them , in addition to the unemployment benefit . In principle, all recipients of MI benefits are entitled to all social care, healthcare, rehabilitation, employment , and educational services.  Whereas for  housing allowance there are no requirement s to participate in activation o r any other labour market measures , there are some requirements as regards the LMS and social assistance .  The following sections, first, outline the features of the MI support in place; secondly, describe the eligibility cr iteria and coverage and consider  the adequacy of the financial support provided and the links with other benefits; thirdly, examine the extent of integration with labour market measures to help those supported into employment; fourthly, consider the acces s provided for the people concerned to social services; fifthly, summarise the governance mechanisms in place; and, finally, review the evidence on the impact on reducing poverty and assisting beneficiaries to find work.  An annex outlines the underlying s ituation in terms of the relative number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion and the changes that have occurred over recent years, as well as the characteristics of the people concerned – their gender, age, employment status, education level, country of birth and the structure of the households in which they live. As such, it provides the context in which MI support is operating and indicates the groups on which support needs to be targeted.  1 Description of national schemes providing minimum inc ome support  Finnish social security  consists of three parts. The first part universally guarantees minimum income (MI) security for all legal Finnish residents (rather  than citizens)1. It includes ‘basic level’ income transfer benefits2 paid either at a  flat rate or after means -testing based on personal or household income. The second part consists of income -related social insurance for those in employment. The third part of the system includes municipal social care and healthcare services that universal ly cover all legal residents (see Figure 1; Kela, 2021a).   1 Asylum -seekers are not entitled to social security in Finland. However, they have the right to reception services which safeguard their necessa ry financial support and care. The right to get services continues through the processing of the asylum application.  The reception centre pays a reception allowance until the asylum application has been processed. In 2021, the amount of the monthly recepti on allowance (if they were not entitled to food in the reception centre) was €267 for people over 18, €316 for single parents, and €202 for children.   2 For example , minimum sickness allowance, minimum unemployment benefits, maternity benefits, housing allowance and social assistance (income support).  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  2  Figure 1.  The structure of the Finnish social security system.    The payment of different forms of MI security – such as the labour market subsidy (LMS), housing allowance and social assistance – is rather parallel than sequential : that is, benefits are often paid on top of one an other , and complement one an other (THL, 2019; Kangas & Simanainen, 2021). This is the case with the LMS (Kela, 2021b), hous ing allowance (Kela, 2021c), and social assistance (Kela, 2021d). Because of the intertwining nature of these three forms of basic/minimum security benefits, all of them are described and discussed in the subsequent sections of the report.  Labour market subsidy   The LMS ( työmarkkinatuki ) is payable to unemployed people residing in Finland aged 17-64. Special activity -related and age -specific requirements must be met in order for people to benefit. The LMS is based on the Act on the Labour Market Sub sidy ( Laki työmarkkinatuesta ) 1542/1993 and on the Act on Unemployment Protection (Työttömyysturvalaki ) 1290/2002. The LMS targets those who are unemployed and enter the labour market for the first time or who have not worked long enough: that is, those wh o do not meet the work requirement (employment of 26 weeks during the 28 months before unemployment), or those whose earnings -related unemployment allowance has expired because the maximum number of days has been used up (Kela, 2021b; Kangas & Simanainen, 2021).  The LMS does not have a maximum benefit duration, and can be paid to long -term unemployed  persons . In 2020, there were 304,559 recipients of the LMS  (192  865 at the end of the year) , and expenditure on the scheme was €1,866,271,058 (Kelasto, 2021a).  Housing benefits  (asumistuki ) are administered and paid out by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) (Kela , 2021c), which supports housing in different ways: there is a general housing allowance system (including for students), a pensioners' housing system, housing assistance for conscripts, student housing supplements, and a substantial amount of social assis tance. All housing benefits are based on national legislation – general housing assistance under Act 538/2014; pensioners' housing allowance under Act 571/2007; and housing assistance for conscripts under Act Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  3  781/1993. All low -income households are univers ally eligible for general housing allowances to help with their housing costs. The housing allowance is granted to the household as a whole. Housing allowances are available for owner -occupied homes, rented homes, right -of-occupancy homes , and part -ownersh ip homes (Kela, 2021c).  However, v ast majority i s granted to rented homes.  The maximum coverage of accepted housing costs is 80%. On average, the coverage is about 50%.   At the end of the December 2020, there were 402,559 households and 859,212 people (16 % of the Finnish population) getting general housing allowance. The expenditure on it in December 2020 was €134,578,666, and for the whole of 2020 it was €1,566,478,510 (Kelasto, 2021b). For most recipients the allowance is temporary and the average length  of payment is 20 months.  Social assistance (toimeentulotuki ) is a last -resort income transfer scheme that supports individuals and families whose income and assets do not cover their essential daily expenses. Social assistance comprises three parts (Act on Social Assistance , 1412/1997). First, basic social assistance ( perustoimeentulotuki ) is paid by Kela . Second, supplementary social assistance ( täydentävä toimeentulotuki ) is paid to cover certain additional costs. Third, preventive social assistance ( ehkäisevä toimeentulotuki ). The supplementary and preventive components of social assistance are administered and paid out by municipalities . Social assistance as a whole is the last -resort benefit to which the right is determined on the basis of an assessme nt of the individual situation of the person and the family. The amount of the support is determined by assessing the difference between income and expenditure, and it is thus also different for different individuals and families in different months.  In ce rtain situations, social assistance can also be partly paid directly to cover the necessary living expenses of a person or family.  In 2020, the total number of recipient households was 310,884 (9.9% of all households) and the number of recipient individual s was 464,236 (8.4% of residents). 96% of these  received the basic amount, 2% received supplementary assistance, and 1% received preventive social assistance. Total expenditure on social assistance was €791,499,000. 96% of the spending was on basic social assistance (THL, 2021).  Important changes  In 2017, basic social assistance was transferred from the municipalities to Kela. This reduced non -take -up rates by harmonising the application process and making it more formal and less stigmatising (Hytöne n, 2020). In 2018, the centre -right government introduced the ‘activation model’. Benefits for unemployed people were cut if they did not show enough activity in terms of employment or participation in labour market measures. In 2019, the succeeding centre -left government abolished the activation model (Kangas & Kalliomaa -Puha, 2019a).  Due to COVID -19, a temporary LMS for the self -employed was introduced. The change was effective from 16 March 2020 to the end of 2020 (Kangas, 2020). Reductions in social ass istance benefits due to non -compliance (e.g. people refusing to accept a work offer or not participating in labour market measures) were not strictly applied. Temporary additional compensation (€75 per month per household member) towards basic social assis tance was introduced, from 1 March 2020 to the end of 2020. The pandemic did not cause any changes in the housing allowance system (Kangas, 2020).  Multiple reforms  that affect minimum income benefit receivers  are being prepared  or implemented in Finland  right now. Changes due to these are not taken into account in this fiche.  The Nordic labour market service model that reforms services and obligations of the unemployed entered into force on 2 May 2022. Healthcare and social welfare services Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  4  will be reformed  in Finland from 2023  on. The responsibility for organising these services will be transferred from municipalities to wellbeing services counties.  Parliamentary committee work to reform social security as a whole has been launched in Finland 2020 and it wi ll continue its work until 2027. It addresses questions related to basic social security, earnings -based benefits and social assistance, and examines the financing and connections between these forms of support.  A government proposal for the reform of the  Act on Social assistance is to be submitted this spring. The aim of the reform is to improve the status of social welfare and vulnerable clients as social assistance applicants and to improve their access to services. The proposed amendments to the Act on  Social assistance are intended to enter into force at the beginning of 2023.  1.1  Eligibility  Frequency of update  The recipients of the LMS and basic social assistance report their status every month. As a rule, social assistance is granted for one month , but it can also be granted for a shorter or longer period. Housing allowances are granted for one year. However, recipients have to immediately report to Kela any significant changes in their living situations (e.g. income or household composition).  Income/a ssets taken into account  The income test for the LMS takes into account a person’s own income from employment . Capital  and other income  are taken into account separately from income from employment . However, LMS receivers rarely have capital income . Income from employment below €300 is not taken into account  in LMS . Income above this threshold reduces the benefit by rate of 50%.  On the other hand, in the case of capital or other income  (for example other social benefits) , for single people, the LMS is  reduced by income that exceeds the threshold of €311 per month. The reduction is 75% of the full amount of the LMS. Parents’ income also affect LMS for those living in their parents’ household. Usually LMS is reduced by 50 % for a person living in their parents’ apartment.  For housing allowance, income covers wages and salaries, income from self -employment, capital income , and most social transfers (e.g.  unemployment and sickness benefits, and child homecare allowance). The amount of housing allowance depe nds on the composition of the household, municipality , and monthly gross income. A deduction of €300 is made from each household member's income . Income above the €300 reduces the allowance by rate of 42 % . There is a statutory maximum limit on acceptable housing costs, which varies between municipalities.  In the case of social assistance, the income taken into account is defined as disposable income (after tax). Earned income exceeding €150 per month reduces benefits. In principle, all other social benefi ts (such as the LMS) reduce social assistance. Real property and assets owned by a person belonging to the household are taken into account  Exempt income/assets  For the LMS , the following income is not taken into account: child allowance, family pension, child homecare allowances, housing allowance, disability indemnity, conscript  allowance , and  social assistance.  For the housing allowance, a deduction of €300 is made from each household member's income (i.e. €300 of this is exempt).  For social assistance,  reduction of privileged income from earned income max. EUR 150 , wages and benefits deemed insignificant (€50 for a single  person  and €100 for a household per month) are exempted . Also exempt are: regular income and assets of a Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  5  child under 18  insofar as they exceed the expenses to be taken into account for the child’s part ; reimbursement of travel -to-work and other work -related costs; activation supplements; certain social benefits (maternity benefits and disability allowances); and assets regard ed as essential for living (e.g. owning a house or flat). These do not affect benefits (Kela, 2021d).  How the criteria for assessment were chosen  The criteria used for assessment are the result of a long historical political process, and it is therefore di fficult to provide a more detailed description of how and why the specific criteria concerned were chosen (Kuivalainen, 2013). As a result, there is a constant debate about  how to safeguard adequate benefits without creating excessive  work disincentives.  Assessment: concerns  There are complaints that the co -ordination between Kela (which grants basic social assistance) and municipalities (responsible for additional and preve ntive social assistance) does not work well enough; and that vulnerable clients often cannot cope with the bureaucracy and fall between different agencies (National Audit Office of Finland, 2020a; Järvinen, 2021). One specific concern is the rather high re jection rate (48.2% in 2021) for social assistance. Another concern is the weak connection between benefits in cash and benefits in kind (Hytönen, 2018; see also Ilmakunnas, 2017 and 2019).  Proof of eligibility  As an unemployment benefit, LMS can only be received by unemployed persons available for and seeking for full time job. In order to receive the LMS, a labour market statement issued by employment services must prove that an applicant his/her individual employment plan as an unemployed job seeker. The LMS is income -tested ; therefore, most recipients are in the lowest income deciles. There are  no exact numbers on non -take -up rates available , but rates are probably quite low.  In 2020, rejection rate3 was 13.3% (from direct correspondence with Vesa Ylön en, chef of the statistics in Kela). The main reasons are non -attendance at periodic interviews (about 60%) or a failure to follow the employment plan (40%) (Halmetoja & Korpela, 2020). Unemployed people  may lose  access to the LMS if they refuse to work, p articipate in activation , or interrupt their studies (Haapakoski, 2021; Raittila et al ., 2018); in these cases they are in many cases entitled to last -resort social assistance.  Young unemployed u nder 25 year s of age without vocational education have additi onal obligations. They need to apply to studies in order to be eligible for LMS.  1.2  Coverage  The strength of the Finnish basic security system is that it covers all residents and is rather comprehensive. There are no upper limits on the duration of the LMS . Furthermore, social assistance, though means -tested, is based on strong claim rights guaranteed by the constitution. The level of benefits can be reduced by a maximum of 40% , but the rest is a kind of basic income  for the claimant. The housing allowance system  and social assistance system , together with the ‘housing first ’ national policy , has contributed to a very low number of homeless people in Finland (Kangas & Kalliomaa -Puha, 2019b). The problem is that the le vels of individual benefits are rather low, and the MI bundle often consists of a number of income -tested benefits paid on top of one another, which creates high effective marginal tax rates (Haapakoski, 2021; Kangas & Simanainen, 2021, pp 13 -15).  LMS is p ayable to unemployed  people residing in Finland age d 17-64. There are special activity -related  and age -specific requirements for younger unemployed people   3 By definition, people whose application is rejected are not ‘non -takers’ . Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  6  (Kela, 2021b; Kangas & Simanainen, 2021). In December 2020, 44% of the recipients of unemployment ben efits received the LMS (the rest received income -related daily allowances4 or other unemployment -related benefits ). It is not possible to provide exact take -up or non -take -up rates. In 2020, the rejection rate for the Kela -administered  unemployment benefi ts was 23%.  In the case of younger unemployed  people , the LMS may be refused  if the claimant is not participating in education or in any labour market measures.  As a rule, recipients of the LMS are low-income people. In 2019, about 60% of the recipients were in the two lowest income deciles (Statistics Finland, 2021 a). A review of status is conducted on a monthly basis.  Housing benefits  are universally available to low -income households to assist with their housing costs (Kela, 2021c). About 1 6% of the Finnish population gets housing allowances. Thus, not all the recipients of housing allowance are on MI support. However, a majority (60%) of the recipients receiving general housing allowance are in the two lowest income deciles5 (Statistics Fi nland, 2021a).  Eligibility for the housing allowance is based on formal rules, and there is no discretion. Benefit decisions are for one year. The main reason for the rejection of applications (27% in 2020) is excessive income. In 2021, the upper monthly i ncome limits for different households in the most expensive municipality (Helsinki) were as follows: €1,901 for a single person; €3,395 for a single parent with two children; €2,556 for a couple without children; and €3,880 for a couple with two children. The corresponding income limits in the cheapest municipality category were €1,502, €2,673, €1,985, and €3,073 (Kela, 2021c; see also Section 1.3).  One way of trying to estimate  the extent of the non -take -up of housing allowance is to compare total (actual ) spending with simulated spending, as done in Honkanen (2020: p. 40). The comparison of the actual and simulated ‘would -be’ expenditures acts as a proxy for the non -take -up rate, of 14%. In her analysis of take -up rates, Paukkeri (2018: p. 30) provided si milar figures (the take -up rate she calculated was 85%).  Whereas the receipt of housing benefits is based on formal regulations, social assistance  procedures contain discretion and stronger means -testing. However, there are still elements of strong claims rights. As a last -resort benefit, eligibility for social assistance cannot be denied, for example , due to refusal to work. The benefit can be reduced by a maximum of 40% for a certain period , but it cannot be totally denied (Moisio, 2021). Social assistanc e for individuals is reviewed every month.  An important reform took place in 2017 , when basic social assistance was centralised , from the municipalities into Kela. The aim was to diminish the high non -take -up rates (estimated to vary between 30% and 70%; K uivalainen , 2013). To some extent, formalising the application process and rules for eligibility ha s produced the desired results, but the rejection rate of applications is still high (50% in 2020).  It is impossible to obtain exact numbers for non -take -up rates . However, the transfer of basic social assistance from municipalities to Kela seems to have reduced the non -take -up rates. A rough estimate is about 30% (Tervola, 2021).  In 2019, 68% of the recipients of social assistance were in the two  lowest income deciles.  1.3  Adequacy  In recent years, the European Committee of Social Rights has recommended that Finland improve the adequacy of its MI protection (Tervola et al ., 2019). The adequacy  4 In order to be entitled to income -related benefits, unemployed people must have been insured by a voluntary unemployment fund [ työttömyyskassa ] for 26 weeks before becoming unemployed.  Whereas the funds are responsible for paying out the income -related benefits, Kela pays out the minimum benefits.  5 In 2019, the gross annual mean household income for those getting the benefit was €1 4,395 in the 1st income decile and €24,779 in the 2nd decile (Statistics Finland, 2021a).  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  7  of MI protection in Finland depends on whether we look at the level of a single benefit or the level of the combined MI basket. Furthermore, family type and life situation have an impact on the results. When these aspects are taken into consideration , the Finnish adequacy levels are either in the middle or close to the top among the EU Member States ( Ilmakunnas & Moisio, 2018 and 2019).  The monthly  amount of the  LMS  is €726 for a single person. The benefit is increased if the claimant cares for children under 18. The increases (per day) are €5.30 for one child, € 7.78 for two children, and €10.03 for three or more children. While participation in the active labour market  measures or other forms of activation , an increase of €4.80 per day for 200 days will be paid (Kela , 2021b).  The LMS is taxable income.  With regar d to the level and adequacy of housing allowance , it is impossible to provide exhaustive answers. The amount depends on the composition of the household, household income, the form and level of housing costs , and the municipality of residence. There are four groups of municipalities ranked  according to housing costs6. In each municipality group, there are ceilings for accepted housing costs to be taken into consideration when calculating the size of the allowance. In 2020, t he maximum compensation paid was  80% of the accepted housing costs. On average, compensation was 50% (Kela, 2021c). If housing costs exceed the maximum limit, the claimant s can seek compensation from social assistance  if they are eligible for social assistance . Housing costs are  often  fully covered  by social assistance (Moisio, 2021). Thus, social assistance is de facto an addit ional form of housing subsidy.  Housing allowance is not taxable income.  The basic amount of social assistance  is €504 per month for a single person and €932 for a co -habit ing couple. The basic amounts for children under 10 are €318 for the first child, €292 for the second child, and €267 for each consecutive child. The corresponding amounts for children  aged  10-17 are €353, €328 , and €302 (Kela, 2021d).  How ever, as social assistance is a last resort benefit, these are not the amounts of social assistance  in practice . The amount is calculated for each household according to income and expenses. If the recognised expenses are higher than the income, the differ ence between the expenses and income is paid to the applicant as social assistance.  Average monthly amount of basic social assistance per person in 2020 was EUR 367.  Social assistance is not taxable income.   Regarding supplementary and preventive social as sistance, they are always  case -sensitive , and the benefit amounts vary according to the needs of the client.  The levels of MI benefits follow the consumer price index, mostly through their link to the national pension index. In addition to increases due to index changes, the government can decide on ad hoc increases. In principle, the national pension index is updated every year. However, indexation freezes or cuts have sometimes (e.g. 2017 -2019) been used as a means of reducing public spending, which has affected MI transfers in particular (Honkanen, 2021).  Table 1 gives an example of the composition  of the MI package in the case of an unemployed LMS recipient.  Especially in larger cities, rents are often much higher than in these examples. Therefore, a household would usually receive social assistance to cover its housing costs in addition to the housing allow ance.   6 The first group consists of the most expensive municipalities (Helsinki) , and the four th consists of the cheapest (rural) municipalities. If actual housing costs exceed the maximum limit, the allowance is calculated on the maximum housing costs. The maximum housing costs in Helsinki are as follows: one -person  household , €521 per month; two  people,  €757; three people,  €960; four  people,  €1,122 ; plus  €144 for each additional household member. In the cheapest municipality category , the amounts are €353 , €514 , €657 , €783 and €115, respectively.

Benefit calculations are based on the SISU micro -simulation model (Pertti Honkanen, 2021); Poverty thresholds: Statistics Finland 2021b.  The adequacy of the LMS or basic social assistance can be evaluated by reference to the 60%, 50%, or 40% poverty thresholds, or to the monetary value of the minimum consumption basket (for example, Kangas et al ., 2013; Niemelä & Raijas, 2013; Mäkinen, 2018  and 2021).  In 2019, the LMS for a single person (€724) was 57% of the 60% poverty threshold for a single person (€1,280; Statistics Finland, 2020). The corresponding shares for the 50% and 40% poverty thresholds were 68% and 85%. For the basic amount of social assistance, the shares were much lower (39%, 47%, and 59%, respectively). The total net MI is roughly the same as the 50% poverty threshold and higher than the 40% poverty threshold.  Minimum benefits can also be assessed by comparing them with the monetary value of the minimum consumption budget, which was €1,170 per month for a single person in 2021 (Lehtinen, 2021: p.23; see also Ilmakunnas & Mäkinen, 2021; Mäkinen, 2018 and 2021). As Table 1 indicates, whereas the value of the total net MI basket  is approximately 80 -90% of the value of the minimum consumption basket, the values of the LMS and basic amount of social assistance are much lower (58% and 40%, respectively).   7 Housing costs for each type of household are take n from Lehtinen (2021 ); and housing allowances are calc ulated for the medium -size township of Jyväskylä, which represents the municipal category III.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  9  The shares indicate that , in order to reach different poverty threshold levels or the value of the minimum consumption basket, a combination of the three basic benefits is needed. However, the combinatory approach does not work  in all cases, and for various reasons the levels described in Table 1 are not reached. There may be unpaid waiting periods, there may be cuts , and benefits may be reduced. The risk of poverty is therefore still high (Statistics Finland, 2019; see also Table 2 in Section 5).  1.4  Links with other benefits  The LMS, housing allowance , and social assistance are closely intertwined. In 2020, there were 201,300 unemployed people receiving minimum unemployment benefits (the LMS or minimum unemployment allowance from Kela ). 26%  of these individuals were also receiving housing allowance, 3% received social assistance , and 33%  simultaneously received all three benefits. Correspondingly, out of the 304,700 recipients of housing allowance , 17% received minimum unemployment benefits, 16% received social assistance, and 22% received all three benefits. Of the 146,900 recipients of social assistance, 4% also received minimum unemployment benefits, 34% were entitled to housing allowance, and as many  as 46% received all three benefits (Korpela, 2021). The level of any one minimum (basic) income benefit is not sufficient to reach the va lue of the minimum consumption budget or different poverty thresholds (see Section 1.3).  2
