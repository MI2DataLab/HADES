Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  The main minimum income scheme in France is the active solidarity income (revenu de solidarité active  – RSA ), created by Law No 2008 -1249 of 1 December 20081. Its purpose is “ to provide its beneficiaries with adequate means of existence, in order to fight against poverty, encourage the exercise or return to a professional activity and help the social integration of the beneficiaries ”2. It replaces previous social benefits , including the RMI ( revenu minimum d’insertion ) which was created in 1988.   1 https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000019860428   2 Idem . Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge  gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   March ,  2022  2  Originally, the RSA consisted of two  part s: the  ‘RSA base ’ (RSA socle ); and the ‘ RSA activity ’ (RSA activité ), which supplement ed income from activity , aim ed at  encouraging employment. As of 1 January 2016, the RSA a ctivity  as well as another employment incentive scheme – the employment bonus (prime pour l’emploi ) – were  replaced by a new scheme, the activity bonus (prime d’activité )3. The specific solidarity allowance (allocation de solidarité spécifique  – ASS ), for its part, is paid to job -seekers when they have exhausted their unemployment rights. It is defined by the labour code4. The ASS ceases in a certain number of situations, in particular in the event of the resources required exceeding the ceilings, an absence of job -search, the failure to follow paid training or  the resumption of an activity not consistent with the receipt of ASS. People  can in these cases make a request to benefit from the RSA.  1.1  Eligibility  Anyone residing in France permanently , whose h ousehold has resources below a certain threshold of guaranteed income, is entitled to the RSA  under certain  conditions defined in the social action and families code5. This includes refugees but not asylum -seekers, though there is a specific allowance for  these ( allocation pour demandeur d’asile ). It also includes homeless people so long as a social centre provides a domicil e for them.  In order to be e ligib le for the RSA , claimants must : 1) be aged over 25  – although t he RSA is open, under certain conditions, to people aged 18 -24 if they are single parents or have at least two years of professional activity  during the last three years ; 2) be French or have held a residence permit authorising work for at least five years (this condition is not appli cable to refugees, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, stateless persons , and foreigners holding a residence card or a residence permit provided for by treaties and international agreements and conferring equivalent rights ); 3) not be a pupil, student or trainee; and 4) not be on parental or sabbatical leave, unpaid leave or on stand -by.  There was a significant debate in 2020 -21 on the eligibility of young people under 25 for the RSA, in the context of the way COVID -19 emphasis ed youth poverty and difficulties in accessing the job market6. Many NGOs and academics campaigned for the inclusion of young people as beneficiaries of the RSA7. On 2 November 2021, the government announced the establishment of a youth engagement contract ( contrat d’engagement  jeunes ) for all young people under 26 without training or employment for several months , and under 29 when disabled . The government insisted that it should not be conceived of as a universal minimum income for young people , but as financial compensation g ranted to the young people targeted who enrol on a path of integration. They will receive 15 -20 hours of support per week to help them find a job or training. An allowance of up to €500 per month (under resources conditions) may be paid subject to income t hresholds, attendance and acceptance of activity offers made. This measure will come into force in March 20228.   3 Law No 2015 -994 of 17 August 2015 relating to social dialogue and employment : https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000031046061.  4 Article  5423 -1 of the labour code: https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000038951963.   5 Sub -section 1: Conditions for entitlement (Articles L262 -2 to L262 -12). 6 Parents need to take care of children below the age of 25, under the civil code Articles  371 -2: “Each of the parents contributes to the support and education of the children in proportion to their resources, those of the other parent, as well as the needs of the child.”  7 Cf. https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/12/01/pouvoir -beneficier -du-rsa-des -18-ans -une -necessite -en-ces -temps -de-crise_6061722_3232.html   8 https://www.gouvernement.fr/lancement -du-contrat -d-engagement -jeune -jusqu -a-500 -eu-par -mois  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge  gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   March ,  2022  3  The amount of the RSA depends on the resources of applicant s and of the members of their  household s (i.e. all the people filling out a single tax return: for example, civil partner, husband, wife and dependent children).  The amount of the RSA is equal to the difference between the lump sum fixed by decree and the total  of the household's resources9. The amount of resources taken into account is  the monthly average of the resources received during the three  months preceding the request.  The amount of the RSA is  therefore  calculated each trimester after the first request , based on  the households’ income evolution .  Regarding COVID -19-related changes, f or all those who fulfilled the eligibility criteria for the RSA in September or October 2020, there was a one -off supplementary payment of €150 per adult and €100 for each dependent child.  The ASS  guarantees a minimum income for active people  who have exhausted their ordinary unemployment benefits. Claimants must be fit for work and should perform positive and repeated acts to find a job or start / take over a business. Regarding previous activity, claimant s must have worked for at least  five  years (full time or part time) during the 10 years before the end of the last employment contract. If the y have ceased activity to raise a child, the five  years are reduced by one  year per child up to a limit of three  years.  There is no explicit age  condition, but claimants  should not fulfil the conditions for drawing a full pension ( age 62). There is no nationality condition, but foreigners must be legally resident in France. In 2021, t heir monthly resources must not exceed €1,183.70  for single peop le or €1,860.10 for households . The amount considered is the average of the previous  12 months of the total resources received  before the month of the request10.  The activity bonus is a ‘top -up’ income  supplement  in case s of low earnings from work. To be  eligib le, claimants must: be  older than 18; live in France on a settled  basis; and  exercise a professional activity. Their  monthly work income must be below a threshold, which depends on the family composition  (see 1.3 Adequacy, for details) . The income taken into account in calculati ng the amount of the activity bonus includes beneficiar ies’ salaries and their  taxable income (income from capital and property). A series of social benefits are considered, such as unemployment benefits, family or housing allowances, retirement pension, disability pension, and alimony. Childcare allowances are not included.  1.2  Covera ge 1.94 million households benefited from the RSA  in France by the end of June 2021. Including  spouses and dependent children, 3. 88 million people were covered, or 5.7% of the French population11. 58% of beneficiaries were single people without children , and 32% of beneficiary households were single -parent families. Couples (with or without children) were therefore in the minority. Half ( 54%) of beneficiaries were women. 83% had  been receiving the RSA for two years or more , and 49% for five years or more. Most ( 96%) were aged  25-64. T hose aged 25-29 were  particularly over -represented  (17% of beneficiaries , compared with  8% in the whole of the French population).   9 A long  list of resources is taken into account in calculat ing the right to the RSA, among which  are  income from salaried and non -salaried activity, exceptional resources ( e.g.  sale of a house), invested capital, rents, certain allowances or social benefits , and unemployment benefits . See: https://www.service -public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F24585 . 10 The resources taken into account are the claimant’s resources subject to income tax .  11 Data from : Minima sociaux et prestations sociales  : Ménages aux revenus modestes et redistribution ,   Panorama de la DREES  (Chapter 23 on RSA), 2020: https://drees.solidarites -sante.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2020 -10/drees_ -_pano_ -_minima_sociaux_ -_assemblage_ -_bat_ -_210920.pdf . Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge  gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   March ,  2022  4  By the end of June 2021, 18% of households receiving RSA also benefited from the activity bonus , as it is possible to combine both benefits .  Geographical data show a close link between the  number of RSA recipients and the number of registered unemployed  people . The correlation coefficient between the share of RSA beneficiaries in the populatio n of a local authority area  (département ) and the unemployment rate is 0.95. The correlation is also very high with the number of people in poverty (income below 60% of the median ): in mainland France, it is 0.8012. It is difficult to detail coverage in terms of different income groups for each of these minimum income schemes. The research department of t he Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (DREES) publishes data on all ‘social minima’ (grouping several minimum income schemes), including t he RSA, ASS, and other benefits for certain categories of people13. At the end of 2019 , 10% of the population were covered by these social minima (including spouses and dependants). In 2019 , for all French households, these social minima represented 1.7% of disposable income, and the activity bonus 0. 5%14. For households in the bottom income decile, the social  minima represent ed 17.6 % of disposable income , and the activity premium 2.6%. For households at  risk  of poverty (below 60% of natio nal median income – €1,063 in 201 8), the social minima represent ed 13.8% of disposable income , and the activity bonus 2.7%. The DREES also uses another indicator of poverty, in terms of living conditions. The indicator ‘ poverty rate in living conditions ’ addresses the notion of poverty through the deprivation and difficulties experienced by households. 27 difficulties are covered , across  four dimensions: budgetary constraints, late payments, consumption restrictions , and housing difficulties. At the end of 2018, around two -thirds of RSA (68%) and ASS (63%) beneficiaries were poor in terms of living conditions15. This represent ed 46% of the recipients of the activity bonus.  In 2017, for households  at risk  of poverty , the average initial income before transfers was €785 and their disposable income after transfers (including all social benefits16) was €1,188. The social minima , as defined above, including in particular the RSA and ASS, correspond ed to an average transf er of €155 per poor household. The activity bonus correspond ed to an average transfer of €3217. Regarding non -take -up, the latest data concerning the RSA  date from a 2011 survey18. The RSA at that time  consisted of a base part, corresponding to the current  RSA, and an activity part, merged in 2016 with the employment bonus to create the activity bonus. According to this survey, in the last quarter of 2010 the take -up rate for  the RSA was on average 50%: 64% among those eligible for the RSA base only, 67% am ong  12 Idem . 13 Namely, the allowance for disabled adults (AAH), minimum old -age allowances (ASV and ASPA), supplementary disability allowance (ASI), asylum -seeker allowance (ADA), temporary waiting allowance (ATA), solidarity income (RSO), widowhood allowance (AV) , and equivalent replacement retirement allowance (AER -R). 14 Data from  : Minima sociaux et prestations sociales  : Ménages aux revenus modestes et redistribution , Panorama de la DREES , 2020 : https://drees.solidarites -sante.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2020 -10/drees_ -_pano_ -_minima_sociaux_ -_assemblage_ -_bat_ -_210920.pdf . 15 Ibid , p. 98.  16 That is: all s ocial minima (including RSA a nd ASS), family and housing allowances, activity bonus.  17 Ibid , p. 28.  18 Domingo P., Pucci M.

It was thus estimated that nearly 1.7 million people eligible for the RSA (base or activity) in the last quarter of 2010 were not beneficiar ies, resulting in an undistributed amount of around €432 million. Lack of knowledge , refusal of assistance, misunderstanding  about the RSA on the part of those eligible essentially explains non -take -up. In the  survey, only marginal numbers of those eligibl e mention ed a low financial interest in the service or the fear of losing related rights as reasons for non -take -up. The DREES evaluation of the activity bonus  carried out  in 2017 – one year after its implementation  – estimated a take -up rate of 73%. This level of non -take -up (27%) was much lower than that in 2011 for the RSA activity. These figures have not been  updated since, and in particular not since the sharp increase in the activity bonus decided by decree at the start of 2019. The statistics19 show a sharp increase in the number of beneficiaries of the activity bonus from the end of 2018 following the announcement of a revaluation of the bonus on 1 January 2019, which according to the DREES20 could suggest that the non -take -up rate is falling , even though the revaluation enlarged the basis of potential claimants.  A new DREES evaluation21 explains that a  third of eligible households do not use the RSA on average each quarter and a fifth on a long -term basis . There is now new informati on about the activity bonus is this evaluation.  There are no data concerning the take -up rate  of the ASS , as observed in a report from the National Assembly22. The complexity of access to the French social benefit system has been underlined by various rep orts. This complexity can lead to non -take -up23. A study recently showed the difficulty of applying for the RSA,  as it is now required  preferentially  to make the request online24.  1.3  Adequacy  The amount of the RSA is calculated, for each household, by taking  the differential between: 1) a lump sum whose level varies according to the composition of the household and the number of dependent children; and 2) all of the household's resources, excluding those limited by law . The fraction of the professional income  of household members and the lump sum are fixed by decree. The amount s are revised once a year by decree, according to the evolution of consumer prices.  In 2022 , the RSA  is equal to € 575 per month  in gross terms (the RSA is not taxable)  for single people without children; € 863  per month  for couple s without children; €1 ,036 per  19 http://www.caf.fr/presse -institutionnel/recherche -et-statistiques/publications/prime -d-activite -conjoncture   20 « Le non -recours  aux prestations sociales .

For single parent s, the amount was  €863  per month  for one  child , and €1,036 per month  for two  children25. For any additional children or household members, the increase f or each was  €230 per month .  The amounts are adjusted each year in April according to the annual variation in the national price index26. The amount for single people without children slightly increased from € 565.34  in 202 1 to € 575.52  in 2021.  The amounts payable are reviewed each quarter. The payment is made continuously for three  months (usually paid on the 5th of each month). After thre e months, a new declaration and request must be made to obtain an adjustment and/or extension. The claimant makes a declaration of honour with respect to the correctness of the information provided on the printout of the claim and transfers of supporting d ocuments to the investigating bodies. The latter may  verify the information submitted, by requesting the claimant to produce new documentary evidence or by obtaining information from tax authorities, social security institutions , and bodies dealing with supplementary pensions or unemployment insurance.  The amount of the ASS  depends on the level of recipient s’ resources. Beneficiaries can receive an allowance at  the full rate or at a reduced rate , depending on the amount of their resources. The daily amount  is currently €16.91 in gross terms ( the ASS is taxable) or €507 .30 per month (base: 30 days) for single people  with resources below €676 .40 per month ; €1 ,183 .70 minus claimants ’ monthly resources for single people  with resources between €676 .40 and €1 ,183 .70 per month . For couple s with resources below €1,352 .80 per month  the amount is €507 .30 per month . For couple s with resources between €1 ,352 .80 per month  and €1 ,860 .10 per month , the amount is €1 ,860 .10 minus claimants' monthly resources.  For recipients, the ASS is reviewed and renewable every six months ; but job -seeker s must make their  declaration of activity monthly, so it is possible that their  allowance undergoes changes according to their  declara tions of activity.  The amount of the daily ASS allowance is set each year by decree27.  Regarding COVID -19-related changes, for all those who fulfilled the eligibility criteria for the ASS in September or October 2020, there was a one -off supplementary pa yment of €150 per adult and €100 for each dependent child.  The amount of the activity bonus  is calculated considering  the following.    On the one hand, a lump sum which varies according to household composition and number s of dependent children28, to which  must be added 61% of household s’ professional income. This amount may be increased through ‘individual bonuses’ , taking into account the professional income of each worker.   On the other hand, households ’ resources29.  25 There are possible increases if t he person becomes a single parent after a life event, such as a separation o r the spouse’s death. This increas e is limited in time. If the event occurs after the dependent child turns 3, the increase lasts 12 months and must be paid during the 18 months following the date of the event. If the event occurs before the dependent child turns 3, the increase lasts unti l the child turns 3. The amounts in this case are: €726 (single pregnant woman), €968 (1 child), €1 ,210 (2 children), and €241 per additional child.  26 https://www.legifrance.gouv. fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000043459557   27 It is currently equal to €16.91. This amount was set by decree No 2021 -523 of 29 April 29 2021.  28 The increase is the following : 50% for the first  additional person, 30% per additional person, 40% per additional person beyond  the third person if the household has more than two  children or dependent people under 25, with the exception of the spouse/co -habiting person . 29 To recap, the amount of the activity bonus = (lump sum, possibly increased + 61% of professional income + individual bonuses)  – the household resources taken into account.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge  gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   March ,  2022  7  The lump sum is revalued each year in April according to the annual variation in the consumer price index between March of year N -1 and March of the year N30. The lump sum was  equal to € 563.68  in 202 2. Regarding the above -mentioned possib ility of individual bonuses, each household member with a professional activity can obtain a bonus which varies according to their  monthly professional income (average over the previous  three  months). This individual bonus is due if the average monthly salary is greater than € 623.63 . The amount of the bonus increases with income. The parameters are fixed by a decree31: for each worker within the household, the bonus is zero when their  monthly professional income is less than or equal to 59 times the minimum wage. Beyond that, it grows proportionately  up to a maximum of  120 times the minimum wage. For example , it is  €19.43  for a monthly income of €700 and € 164.04  if income  is over  €1,1,268.40 .  The amount of the activity bonus change s on a yearly basis  and is indexed  for inflation , just as  the RSA . The last increase occurred in 2022 . No specific adaptation has been made in response to COVID -19.  It should be noted  that the activity bonus targets a population with lower incomes than the former schemes it has replaced. It relies on a more restricted target than them32. The level of income support for the different household types can also be expressed as a percentage of the national at -risk -of-poverty threshold, the national extreme at -risk -of-poverty threshold (40% of m edian)  and the gross minimum wage (of a single earner)33. One can see that the level of the minimum guaranteed income  – the RSA for a single person  – corresponds to half the poverty threshold and a little more than one third of the gross minimum wage.  For a couple with two children, it corresponds to half the poverty threshold and a little more than two  third s of the gross minimum wage . As regards the effects of these minimum income schemes on poverty alleviation, one has to consider together all the social minima  – that is , the  RSA, ASS , and  several other specific allowances. According to a 2021  DREES study, social minima reduce d the poverty rate by 1. 7 points  in 2018 . The activity bonus reduce d it by a further 1.1 points. The effect on the intensity of poverty (the relative gap between the median standard of living of the poor population and the poverty line) was even greater.

The C2S allows any person, with settled residence  in France for more than three  months, to benefit from free complementary health.  They can also benefit from housi ng allowances, and reductions in housing taxes, audio -visual fees , and  social telephony charges . They may also be able to access other forms of local assistance, such as  reduced prices or free access to certain services (such as transport or school meals), depend ing on the measures taken by the local authorities and the services concerned.  It is possible to receive both the RSA and the ASS36. In this case, the amount of the RSA is  reduced by the amount of the ASS.  Similarly, under certain conditions and depending on claimants ’ resources, the RSA can be combined with the activity bonus.  2017 DREES data indicate the cumulative effect of these minimum income schemes and addit ional social benefits37. All these benefits represent 41% of the disposable income of households at  risk  of poverty (compared with  6% for all French households). It was seen above that the social minima represent 13% of disposable income for such household s and the activity bonus less than 3%. In addition, family benefits represent 11% , and housing allowances 14%.  Family benefits help reduce the risk of poverty by 2% and the intensity of poverty by more than 6%. Housing allowances help reduce the risk of p overty by 2% and the intensity of poverty by over 6.5%.  2
