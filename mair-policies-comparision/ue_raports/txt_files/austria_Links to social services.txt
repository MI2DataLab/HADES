Links to social services and integrated provision of targeted social services  Most MMI/SA  legislation by federal provinces stipulates that MMI/SA benefits are not limited to cash benefits and/or benefits in kind, but also entail "advice and support" (or similar). However, the evidence on how this issue is actually dealt with is limited. Accord ing to criticism by social NGOs and the Austrian Anti -Poverty Network (Armutskonferenz ), the welfare offices or district authorities responsible for the implementation of MMI/SA often lack the resources for proper case -management and additional social services / social work. In this context it is also worth mentioning that legislation by federal provinces on MMI/SA lacks explicit reference to multidimensional needs assessments.  Available (but somewhat outdated) research on this issue points in th e same direction (Bergmann et al . 2012; Riesenfelder et al . 2014). Implementation of MMI/SA by the federal provinces often fails to integrate targeted social services, and related programmes in place are often in the form of pilot programmes only, restrict ed to a small number of MMI/SA recipients or specific geographical areas. Overall, the strengthening of integrated case -management or one -stop -shops has been debated for some time, but with only limited impact on actual organisational arrangements.  As a consequence, recipients of MMI/SA  often have to inform themselves about additional advice and support, made available by different social services providers, of which many are social NGOs. Overall, the landscape of such service -providers appears to be rath er fragmented in many federal provinces.  At the same time the PES concentrates on ALMPs in the narrow sense, and has no resources for case -management regarding other targeted social services etc.  4
