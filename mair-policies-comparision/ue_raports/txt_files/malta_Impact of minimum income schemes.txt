Impact of MI schemes  MI schemes have been a permanent feature of Malta’s social security system for many decades now, and they have served to alleviate poverty especially when pension schemes either did not exi st or were very meagre. It is very difficult to establish the precise impact that they have, on their own, on the well -being of the Maltese. What can be examined is the effect on transfer payments on the overall level of poverty in Malta since ad hoc studi es on the direct of MI schemes do not exist.  Table 4 shows the effect of social transfers on the at -risk -of-poverty (ARP) rate in Malta for 2011 to 2020, according to EU -SILC, which is calculated as the percentage point difference in the ARP  rate  (excluding pensions) before  and  after  social  transfers. As can be noted, the effect was higher in the middle of the past decade than it was in 2020. This is probably the result of the fact that cost of living increases were higher than what was captured i n the official COLA mechanism. Despite the fact that Maltese politics has a long -standing social orientation, and different administrations use the annual budget to introduce new social measures that improve social services through increases in the benefit s. These increases are indexed. But these increases seemingly do make up for the difference between incomes and the poverty risk threshold level in a way that allows those under the threshold to go above it. The trend is rather in the opposite direction an d the gap widens. As a result, Minimum Income schemes are obviously negatively affected. This is a concern, and to address it, in the 2022 budget the Government it was announced that it was working on Cost -of-living mechanism for vulnerable families, an in itiative that the Government is currently discussing the proposal with social partners.  Even the Central Bank and the government itself have noted that the cost of living increases negatively impact lower income groups more than other groups in the popula tion.25 It is also to be noted that, especially in the earlier years, the effect of  23 Information on this programme has been provided by Director General of the Economic Policy Department of the Ministry of Finance in a personal communication, dated 3 November 2021.  24 ACT is available at https://sustainabledevelopment.gov.mt/wp -content/uploads/2021/10/ACT521 -%E2%80%93 -Document.pdf  25 See Pace, Y.

No research has been conducted on the relationship between criminal activity and work involvement, neither are sufficient data available to identify how much of the reduction of at -risk -of-poverty rates can be attributed to MI schemes. It is hoped that the various initiatives referred to in se ction 3 above will contribute significantly towards the creation of better audit tracks and more comprehensive data that would allow researchers to better evaluate the role of MI schemes, and to determine whether existent structures are enough to ensure no t only the minimum whereby persons can survive, but enough secure income to reach adequacy levels for all members of society.  The challenges faced by Malta in respect of MI schemes are several. They can be summarised as follows:   The main challenge Malta fa ces in respect of MI schemes is the need to implement the  initiative that was announced in the 2022 budget the Government to develop q Cost -of-living mechanism for vulnerable families. ;  inflation -experience -low -income -households.pdf?revcount=7020. In a pre -2022 budget speech, the Minister of Finance  stated that the COLA mechanism will be supplemented by other measures to ensure that cost of living increases affecting ‘those most in need’ will be properly catered for.

Given the current attempts to  improve the safety net, it would be apposite for a clearly defined policy to be developed and instruments that ensure its implementation to be defined;   The current ‘benefit’ structure is complicated, and to a large extent fragmented. As an intermediary st age until a fully -fledged MI policy is developed, an attempt to integrate the existing elements would be a substantial improvement, both for the beneficiaries themselves and for the administrators that have to manage them;   As 9.4% of the Maltese population  falls  within the category of materially and socially deprived, Maltese policy makers need to very carefully consider what concrete and urgent action needs to be taken to reduce their numbers. The positive effect achieved in the reduction of UB beneficiari es from 4500 in 2013 to a mere 318 at the end of 2021 needs to be extended to ensure that the re -distributive mechanism in the economy benefits all the beneficiaries of MI schemes.
