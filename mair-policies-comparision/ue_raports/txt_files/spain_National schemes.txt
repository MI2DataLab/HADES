Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  Since the 1980s, Spain has developed a complex set of means -tested income support programmes that aim to guarantee  a minimum level of income for specific groups of people. These form a ‘ set’ rather than a ‘system ’ because they reflect different policy processes at differen t levels and areas of government, and arguably do not constitute a consistent and comprehensive MI system.  The set includes benefits  that are a part of the social security system (non -contributory tier) and benefit s from the  field of social assistance. Traditionally, social security is the responsibility of the central government, with regions responsible for social assistance. This division is compounded by the multilevel governance  which may choose to delegate the management of programmes to regions . The  distinction  between non -contributory social security and social assistance is quite b lurr ed. Constitutional court rulings established that the national s ocial security system may expand into the field of means -tested income support (social assistance) with no clear limits , but did not establish the responsibilities and obligations of each level of government. Conversely, regions may set up social assistance schemes, although the limits of (regional and local) social assistance are not legally defined, exce pt through some limitations on supplementing social security pensions and benefits.  Within the social security system, means -tested income support benefits are neatly separated into means -tested (a) pensions and pension supplements (for people out of the labour market because of their age or disability)1, (b) child benefits2, and (c) unemployment assistance benefits. A fourth type of benefit, a Minimum Living Income (Ingreso Mínimo Vital , IMV ) was added  in 2020 . Management of these benefits is divided between social security agencies. Means -tested pension supplements and child benefits are managed by the National Institute of Social Security  (Instituto Nacional de Seguridad Social , INSS). Means -tested non -contri butory pensions (PNCs) are supervised by the  Institute for the Elderly and Social Services  (Instituto de Mayores y Servicios Sociales , IMSERSO ), but management has been delegated to regional governments. Unemployment assistance benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Service  (Servicio Público de Empleo Estatal , SEPE ). The new IMV is managed by the INSS, although delegation to regions has been agreed in two regions , with the possibility of more being added. In social assistance, regional governme nts have established MI  1 The two main means -tested benefits for people out of the labour market because of their age or disability are the ‘minimum pension supplement ’ (for contributory pensioners with low pensions and low income), and non -contributory pensions (PNC) for retired people and people with disabilit ies who do not qualify for a contributory pension. Both belong to the non -contributory tier of national  social security, although the PNCs are managed by regional governments. Some regions have created supplements for PNCs, while others su pplement them via their regional minimum income schemes (RMIs) . 2 Child benefits are means -tested, except for children with disab ilities, which are universal. Existing m eans -tested child benefits are being phased out since the 2020 introduction of the IMV. The extension of the IMV as  a new means -tested  child benefit for households with income above the basic IMV  threshold was recent ly approved in Parliament.   Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes       schemes and other benefits  that vary widely in scope, design, development and coverage.  This country fiche describes benefits and schemes mainly targeting the working -age population, although some partially cover pensioners. The ben efits described are as follows:  1. National non -contributory (means -tested) social security benefits : a) Unemployment Allowance s (UA, Subsidios por desempleo de nivel asistencial ), which includes a variety of means -tested benefits for specific groups of unemploy ed people , most of them time -limited ; b) Unemployment assistance benefits for agricultural labo urers, with special rules . This is partly limited to two regions ; c) Active Integration Income (RAI, Renta Activa de Inserción ), a means -tested activation programme targeting specific groups ; d) IMV, a nationwide MI scheme.  2. Regional social assistance benefits  a) Regional minimum income schemes (RMIs), one for every region and for the two autonomous cities, ranging from full y fledged en titlement -based MI schemes to quite  limited semi -discretionary programmes. All of these schemes are means -tested, and there  is no basic national regulation.  While all of these benefits are means -tested, schemes 1a, 1b and 1c are fixed -amount benefits for u nemployed persons, and 1d and 2a are differential benefits that top -up existing income to a certain guaranteed minimum. The Unemployment Allowance set comprises eight allowances, which may be informally classified into four loose groups.   Allowances for for mer recipients of unemployment insurance, with different means -testing requirements for those younger or older than 45.   Allowances for the unemployed who have contributed less than the minimum year required to access unemployment insurance.   Allowances for the unemployed that are re -entering the (Spanish) labour market after being in jail, recovering from a disability or returning from migration to a non -EEA country.   Special extensions of unemployment assistance benefits for the very long -term unemployed or unemployed persons over 52 who would qualify for a retirement pension.

Exceptional measures were introduced in the minimum guaranteed benefits in order t o address the consequences of the economic and social crisis generated by COVID -19 for the most vulnerable people and households furthest away from the labour market:  Accelerated implementation of IMV. Exceptional measures were also put in place to enable households in emergency situations that did not meet the eligibility requirements for the IMV . For example, households  that d id not fulfil the 'economic vulnerability' criteria for the previous fiscal year could claim the benefit based on data for the current year , while a direct conversion was performed  for c hild benefits (PFHC) recipients for minors without disability o r disability of under 33%  and  who meet certain requirements ;   During 2020, targeted short -term measures were introduced in unemployment assistance benefits. Short -term benefits were introduced for groups ending a contract or benefit without access to othe r benefits , or for workers in specific sectors (cultural, bullfighting , domestic ) experiencing difficulties in carrying out their usual activity and accessing unemployment protection. Also, obligations such as the renewal of subsidies every six months , or the job -seeking requirement , were interrupted or suspended. Unemployment benefits were made compatible with work  in order to promote the temporary recruitment of agricultural workers ; Some regions temporarily modified their RMIs, including urgent approval of new benefits, automatic extension of existing benefits, or exemptions from commitments. Others relaxed eligibility requirements for new beneficiaries or implemented a temporary supplementary benefit (MDSA2030, 2021; Rodríguez -Cabrero et al., 2021; Rodríguez -Cabrero and Arriba, 2022).  1.1  Eligibility  Eligibility criteria vary significantly between benefit types.   Most benefits require the recipient to be either a national or a foreign resident holding a residence permit (IMV and most RMIs), o r a work -and -residence permit in the case of unemployment assistance benefits. Some regional programmes only require the recipient to be a ‘registered resident ’, a condition which is open to foreigners without a residence permit . All require a period of pr evious residence in the region, usually ranging from six months to three years, with exceptions for some cases (victims of gender -based violence, care leavers, etc.).  IMV residence requirements are based on the entire country, allowing for internal mobilit y without losing benefits.   The national IMV and most RMl schemes require  the holder of the provision to be over 23 or 25 years old, but the rest of eventual members of the household can be an exception and be under this age range. Some regions have lowered  the age requirement to 18. While some regions exclude those aged 65+ from their schemes and some exclude pensioners (the IMV and, implicitly, unemployment assistance benefits), others have no age limit. Unemployment assistance benefits require the recipie nt to be of working age, i.e. over 16.   Previous work experience or social insurance contribution is not usually a requirement, but some unemployment assistance benefits require it explicit or implicitly ( e.g. must be a former recipient of unemployment insu rance)  (see Table 2).  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes        Means -testing  varies substantially  between benefit types. The IMV, RMIs and the RAI consider all household members (although the exact definition of household also varies). Most unemployment assistance benefits only consider the clai mant, although some  require having ‘family responsibilities ’, i.e. living with at least one relative who meets the means requirements (there may be others with higher income)  (see Table 2 ).  Income thresholds (which may or may not match the benefit amount) are defined in a variety of ways. Unemployment assistance benefits set the limit at 75% of the national minimum wage, the IMV uses the amount of the national PNC  for one person as its base ( set ‘ arbitrarily ’ every year in the budget act)3, and regional schemes use different methods, either setting it yearly in regional law, or linking it to other indicators , such as the  multiple -effect public income indicator (Indicador Público de Renta de Efectos Múltiples,  IPREM)4, or to regional indicators such as the Catalonia income -sufficiency indicator ( Indicador de Suficiència de Rendes de Catalunya,  IRSC )5.  Assets (defined in different ways and with different limits and exceptions) are considered for the IMV and RMIs, but no t for unemployment assistance. The claimant’s home is not considered when assessing the asset limits, and some other exceptions may apply.   Unemployment assistance benefits are essentially  incompatible with employment (in special cases , a part -time job may be compatible with a part -time UA). In most cases, accepting a job means losing benefits. The IMV is compatible with employment, and some kind of work incentive is foreseen but has yet to be established or regulated. While some RMIs are incompatible with e mployment (either by requiring the recipient to be an unemployed job seeker to claim the benefit , or by explicitly declaring it incompatible , with some exceptions), other regions have advanced compatibility with work -incentive mechanisms (such as tapering) , offering higher guaranteed amounts to persons in employment . The IMV act was finally passed on 26 December 2021 and introduced several changes. The two main changes were the introduction of a child supplement and the possibility of using the current year  for means -testing. The child supplement will cover children living in households with income up to three times the IMV threshold (with additional asset assessment), ranging from EUR 100/month (for children under 3) and EUR 50/month (for children 6 -17). It  will not be considered an independent child benefit, but part of the IMV itself, despite being available to people who do not qualify for the main IMV benefit. Means -testing is still, by default, on income received in the previous calendar year, but betwe en April and December claimants may ask for an assessment based on (partial) current year income. The following year, that yearly income must be reassessed and benefits may have to be reimbursed if the yearly income was in fact above the IMV threshold.  The  complexity and diversity of eligibility criteria is often noted as a serious problem (Fernández et al., 2015; Ayala Cañón et al., 2016b; Ayala Cañón et  al., 2020) . It makes the set of benefits hard to understand, creates gaps and inconsistencies6, raises serious  3 The annual Budget Act sets the amounts of the PNC (and thus that of the IMV), and of the minimum amount for each type of contributory pension. The determination of the amount is a purely political decision and is not linked to any economic or social indicator.  4 Used as a reference index for many benefits, created to unlink benefit amounts and the national minimum wage. Its amount is set in the annual Budget Act.  5 Reference index  created by the Catalan regional government for  regional and local benefits.  6 The many gaps relate to inconsistent requirements. Selective targeting of unemployment assistance benefits can leave unemployed people unprotected because of small differences in age or other characteristics. Regional progra mmes usually require some length of residence in the region, excluding those who have recently moved to the region. The IMV is calculated on the income of the previous year, while the means -test of unemployment Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes       doubts as to the effective targeting of some of these benefits at those in most need7, and its incompatibility (or very limited compatibili ty with employment ) raises concerns about work incentives in some schemes8 (AIR eF, 2019b) . Tables 2 and 3 summari se the eligibility requirements for the main benefit types.   assistance applies month by month, and RMIs u se different assessment periods. Unemployment assistance benefits take RMIs into account for income -testing, and vice versa.   7 Unemployment assistance means -testing is sometimes individual and sometimes requires the recipient to have dependent relatives.  When individual assessment is used, there may be other sources of income in the household that are not considered. At the same time, unemployed persons with little or no household income may be excluded because they do not fit into any of the specific gro ups targeted.  8 Applies mainly to unemployment assistance benefits and to those regional programmes that are either incompatible with employment or that include all earned income from the benefit.
