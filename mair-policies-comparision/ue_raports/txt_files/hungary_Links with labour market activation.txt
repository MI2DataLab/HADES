Links with labour market activation  Not all people in receipt of the benefit for people of active age are required to register with the PES. Persons who receive  the benefit for people suffering from h ealth problems or taking care of a child are not obliged to cooperate with the PES, but can choose whether or not to apply for employment services. By contrast, those who are capable of undertaking work and who are entitled to the ESB are obliged to regist er and cooperate with the PES on jobseeking agreements and participation in public works. Those receiving the ESB must accept any employment opportunity offered. Refusal can result in termination of their ESB, although the service providers interviewed not ed that they try to avoid this in practice.  All jobseekers are profiled and assigned an appropriate client category, including their receipt of the ESB. The largest proportion of ESB beneficiaries are in Profile 314, which is further segmented into ‘assis ted by public works’, ‘to be developed’, or ‘at risk’ (i.e. most difficult to engage in employment). In many cases, a long phase of service is  14 Three main profiles: 1. Independent jobseekers, 2. J obseekers who can be employed with support, 3. Jobseekers requiring complex support.

The services available vary, with those needing complex assistance receivin g social information, reintegration group work, motivational group work and public employment. Previous EU programmes targeted ESB recipients, but this group is no longer a focus, due to a significant overlap with other prioritised groups, such as those wi th only primary education. ESB recipients are offered the option to draw up an individual action plan, which includes their labour market objective (finding a job or becoming self -employed) and the means to achieve it (range of services, support instrument s available, client targets and individual steps). The individual assessment and integration agreement does not include aspects linked to social inclusion beyond integration into the labour market. A new element, providing ‘social information support’, was  introduced in 2020, partly in response to COVID -19 pandemic. However, the real institutional background may be missing and there seems to be significant regional variation15.  An individual action plan is compulsory for severely disadvantaged and disadvan taged applicants. Agreed after the first interview, it covers key elements determined jointly by the case manager and the client. The following services may be offered to clients requiring complex assistance: information provision, social information provi sion, counselling, work counselling, training development preparation, reintegration group sessions, group sessions to develop key skills and key competences for employment, motivational group sessions, mentoring, psychological counselling, assessment of employability skills, assessment of learning skills, assessment of competences, placement in public employment. These services are implemented by local and county department counsellors  and part of them have been  subcontracted to NGO s in the framework of an  EU-funded programme (VEKOP 8.1.2.  and GINOP 5.1.5. ). In 2020, the legal regulations strengthened the PES to provide more flexible employment enhancing services. There is also a move to increase the number of counsellors and alleviate the shortage, togethe r with extending the wider service infrastructure of local networks of providers.  Clients normally report to the department every three months and their compliance with the individual action plan is assessed and modified if necessary. The individual actio n plan is similar to that for other jobseekers, but relies on different tools. Where the client receives the ESB, the profile, segment or activities in their individual action plan may change at the next appointment. If those in receipt of the ESB do not comply with their obligation to cooperate, the PES will write and ask them to do so. If clients still do not comply, they will be called for individual counselling, with failure to comply then resulting in their removal from the register of jobseekers and t he termination of their benefit. Clients will then have to cooperate with the PES for one year in order to reactivate their ESB entitlement. Public works ( közfoglalkoztatás ) is considered an appropriate job for a person receiving the ESB, and the PES will offer such jobs when the opportunity arises. If the client does not accept it, they may be removed from the register of jobseekers and have their ESB terminated.  PES offic es vary regionally and have little scope to involve other services. However, under EU -funded projects, a wider range of services may be temporarily available. In individual cases (mostly in smaller settlements) the local PES may contact family support serv ices about clients' social problems, although they have limited capacity to do so. The PES can also refer clients to other services as part of the provision of social information.  The individual action plan primarily covers labour market services and huma n services (e.g. information provision, individual and group counselling). These elements build on one another and help to motivate the individual to enter public employment or the open labour market. Local initiatives may seek to improve this situation, f or example a cooperation agreement is being prepared between the Health and Social Centre of Salgótarján  and its Region and the Nógrád  County Government  15 This whole section is based on interviews, with relevant data provided by the Ministry of the Interior.

Public works is the most common active labour market policy (ALMP) measure for ESB beneficiaries. The regulations consider public works appropriate employment for ESB recipients and designate them as a special target group. The public works scheme intent ionally provides wages that are significantly (and increasingly) lower than the minimum wage (Albert, 2019), but are nevertheless more than double the amount of the ESB. There is a possibility of providing wage supplements for people employed under the emp loyment support scheme for severely disadvantaged workers, provided they apply no later than the date on which the employment relationship was established. The allowance is granted for the first six months of employment, at the rate of 30% of the minimum w age (HUF 50  220/EUR 137 in 2021). The recent Service Plan drawn up by the PES designates the severely disadvantaged as a priority target group. One problem with access to these supports is that the beneficiaries must apply, which relies on information from  the PES. Furthermore, jobseekers registered for at least one month can also receive wage subsidy from the ongoing labour market programme called ‘Labour Support for Companies’ while those jobseekers more disadvantaged on the labour market can receive supp ort from its targeted sub -elements.  Data on ESB beneficiaries participating in ALMPs are available from the PES Databank and show that training and wage subsidies are by far the most common. No information is available on the impact of take -up of MI benef it and activation services.  There is no framework for tapering benefits after return to the labour market, except for those participating in public works. Recipients of the benefit for people of active age do not, in principle, receive the benefits if they  are participating in ALMP measures. If they participate in training under the EU -funded GINOP 6.1.1, they receive a public employment wage. If they are placed in a labour market programme, they already receive a wage and the employer receives a wage subsi dy to help them into employment. There are provisions for the most disadvantaged groups, which typically include ESB beneficiaries, but the provision is based on labour market status. A person who has been in public employment for at least one month and wh ose public employment is terminated because they work in the private sector, and a person who has been in public employment for at least 180 days in the two years preceding the application may apply for an Employment Support Allowance ( elhelyezkedési támog atás , EHT). The amount of that allowance is twice the amount of the ESB applicable on the date of the application, calculated from the day following the termination of the public employment relationship until the date on which the public employment relatio nship would have continued if no employment had been established. A public work s scheme  who has been in public employment for at least one month and who takes part in seasonal agricultural work under the simplified employment scheme for at least 14 days in  one month may also claim the EHT. During the period of seasonal agricultural work, the daily amount of EHT is HUF 2  000 (EUR 5.50).  A cash benefit may be claimed by a service applicant to enable them to participate in Pes initiatives to help them to find a job and improve their skills. A jobseeking cash benefit may be claimed for continuous use of the service for at least five days, provided the person is not in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or in gainful employment. The daily amount of the benefit  is 70% of the minimum wage, which was HUF 5  390 (EUR 14.70) per day in 2021, for a maximum 90 days in a calendar year16.  If an ESB recipient gets a job, they still receive the full month's benefit in that month of employment but not thereafter. Entitleme nt to the benefit is suspended for 120  16 Government Decree 100/2021 (II.27).
