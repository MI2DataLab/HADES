Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  There are two main minimum income (MI) schemes available to the working -age population in Slovenia: 1) social cash assistance (denarna socialna pomoč,  CSA) based on the MI for various types of individuals, and 2) income supplement ( varstveni dodatek,  IS) that complements CSA.  While CSA is primarily intended to provide last -resort short -term income support (several months), IS pr ovides additional longer term financial support to cover the costs of living (e.g. maintenance of housing, replacement of durables, etc.). All working -age people have an entitlement to CSA, while IS is available only to those who cannot be expected to impr ove their social situation through their own efforts (permanently unemployable persons, those permanently incapable of work, and women older than 63 years /men over 65 years , except those in full -time institutional care) (Social Assistance Payments Act, 201 0 and subsequent amendments ). The expenditure on CSA increased from 0.45% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 to 0.57% of GDP in 2020 (also reflecting a decrease in GDP caused by the COVID -19 pandemic), while the expenditure on IS increased from 0.7% o f GDP in 2018 to 0.9% of GDP in 2020 (MLFSAEO, 2021a; SiStat, 2021a).  Other important additional benefit is emergency  financial social assistance. Those receiving CSA have a right to payment of contributions for mandatory health care insurance and a right to covering the difference to full value of health care services.   1.1  Eligibility  Eligibility for CSA  Those eligible for CSA are citizens with permanent residence in Slovenia, foreigners with a permanent residence permit and permanent residence in Slovenia, persons Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  3  granted international protection and their family members who have obtained a residence permit in Slovenia on the basis of the right to family reunification and have registered permanent or temporary residence in Slovenia, and persons who may claim  this benefit on the basis of international acts binding on the Republic of Slovenia. A means test applies, and the income threshold depends on the number and type of household members (including number of working hours) and the status of a single -parent f amily (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010). The level of MI is based on the Basic Amount of Minimum Income ( osnovni znesek minimalnega dohodka , BAMI, which amounts to EUR 402.18 since 1 August 2019) and the equivalence scale (Social Assistance Payments A ct, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). The weights are defined for nine basic family member types, with additional weights for working 60 -128 hours and 128+ hours per month, and for children maintained by only one parent (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). For exa mple, the income threshold for a two -parent family with one dependent child,  where both parents work 128+ hours per month, is EUR 1  178.39 per month in 2021 (MLFSAEO, 2021b). Assets are taken into account by decreasing the income -based CSA by one -third of the value of the assets in question. As a rule, CSA is not granted if the household assets amount to or exceed 48 times the BAMI (i.e. EUR 19  304.6 4 in 2021) (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). Income thresholds for eligibilit y of single persons and families/households to CSA are adjusted in parallel with the adjustment of the BAMI. The competent ministry has to determine the minimum costs of living every six years using a comparable methodology that is based on the Orshansky m ethodology (1965; 1969). Its two main elements are: 1) a nutritionally adequate food basket at the minimum cost, and 2) the share of expenditure on food  and non -alcoholic beverages  in the total consumption expenditure of non -agricultural households (Stanov nik and Stropnik, 1997; 1998; Stropnik et al ., 2009; Stropnik et al ., 2017; Stropnik, 2020). The food basket and minimum costs of living are calculated for a man aged 19 -65. The MI can be calculated for any household type, using an equivalence scale.  If th e newly determined level of minimum costs of living is 15% (or more) higher than that underpinning the existing BAMI, a new BAMI must be set. In the meantime, the BAMI is indexed annually on 1 March by the consumer price index (CPI) for the previous calend ar year. Current thresholds became applicable on 1 August 2019. The threshold for assets has not been changed since the adoption of the Social Assistance Payments Act in 2010.  Income is defined in net terms (i.e. after deducting taxes and social security contributions) per month, and is calculated over the three calendar months preceding the month of filing the application (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). Exempt income includes subsidies paid from the State budget for specif ic purposes, subsidies for young families for acquiring their first  housing, one -off cash assistance under legislation governing the protection against natural and other disasters, one -off solidarity assistance paid by a trade union to a member, reimbursem ent of damage caused in activities of public interest (defence, protection against natural and other disasters), income associated with agricultural and forestry activity intended to reimburse the costs associated with carrying out the activity, educationa l grants from public sources and foundations paid under specific regulation, supplements to the State educational grant (accommodation, educational achievement, students with special needs), reimbursement of tuition fees/student transport/housing, receipts  intended for payment of education or training, reimbursement of travel expenses to and from work/expenses for meals during work, non -earmarked cash assistance from humanitarian and disability organisations and charities intended for subsistence (up to the  amount of the MI for the particular person), paid alimonies, and 20% of the child allowance - only for the first child in the first income bracket (EUR 23.41 in 2021) (Exercise of Rights to Public Funds Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). Income from ca sual and occasional work is exempt up  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  4  to the level of 0.5 BAMI per month (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). The assets taken into account are: immovable property; personal and other vehicles; watercraft; ownership shares in c ompanies or cooperatives; securities; cash on a transaction or other account, savings and other cash on the statement of the individual; and other movable property. Exempt assets include: the housing where the person/family actually resides and has permane nt residence up to a value of EUR 120  0002; each personal vehicle or single -track vehicle up to the value of 28 times the BAMI (EUR 11  261.04 in 2021), and a personal vehicle adapted for the transport of persons with severe physical impairments; property that is rented or leased; objects that are exempt from execution, except cash; premises, land and movable property used for economic activity that yields income (any agricultural and forest land in case of elderly, ill or disabled persons); funds paid for voluntary/supplementary pension insurance and accumulated on the personal account at the fund or insurance company; housing loans; cash/savings in the amount of three times the respective individual's/family's MI, up to EUR 2  500; in case of (families with ) persons who are permanently unemployable, or permanently incapable of work, or non -employed and older than 63 years for women and 65 years for men, the exempt amount is EUR  2 500 for a single person and EUR 3  000 for a family (Exercise of Rights to Publi c Funds Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). All unemployed CSA recipients are required to register in the Unemployed Persons Register with the employment service (ESS) as unemployed. CSA eligibility is also conditional on signing an individual action pla n or an agreement on the active addressing of social problems (integration plan), fulfilment of obligations and performance of activities set out in that agreement, active job search, inclusion in the active labour market policy (ALMP) measures and accepti ng any adequate/suitable job offered  (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments) . These  conditions do not apply to unemployed persons included in the Register of Temporarily Unemployable Unemployed Persons.  CSA is granted by SWCs, whi ch act as one -stop shops for the delivery of means -tested cash social benefits, subsidies and other payments from public sources (Exercise of Rights to Public Funds Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). Applications can be submitted by mail or in person (e -UPRAVA, 2021a). CSAs collect the information on applicants directly from the claimant and ex officio  from administrative databases. The application form requests information on family members, their in come and assets, and specific relevant details. Proof of eligibility includes: evidence of a material situation not evident from official records (administrative sources); printout of transactions on all family bank accounts for the last three months; and bases for income and asset exemptions or specific circumstances. During the period of receipt of benefits, beneficiaries must notify the competent SWC of any changes likely to affect their receipt of the benefits (changes in relation to family members, inc ome, type of periodic income, etc.) within eight days of the date they became aware of the change. The Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities ( Ministrstvo za delo, družino, socialne zadeve in enake možnosti, MLFSAEO) is competen t for appeals  2 The housing where the person/family actually resides and has permanent residence, worth EUR 120  000 or over, does not count if the social work centre ( Center za socialno delo,  SWC) decides that they cannot temporarily secure a living with this apartment o r residential house due to circumstances beyond their control (e.g. domestic violence, or the process of alienating and dismantling property (not lasting more than 24 months) in order to earn a living). If they  have received CSA more than 18 times in the l ast 24 months, they can be entitled to CSA only if they allow the entry of the prohibition of alienation (sale, transcript, etc.) and encumbrance of all real estate they own in the land register in favour of the Republic of Slovenia. Other assets worth bet ween EUR 19  304.64 and EUR 50  000 are not counted if the SWC decides that they cannot temporarily secure a living with these assets due to circumstances beyond their control (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments).  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  5  against the decisions of the SWCs (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). Eligibility for IS  Eligibility criteria for IS are the same as those for CSA. Persons who are permanently unemployable or permanently incapabl e of work or are women older than 63 or men older than 65 , and are eligible for  CSA  or could be eligible for  it or whose income (or income of the family ) does not exceed their  income threshold  for eligibility for IS , and fulfil other conditions according t o the Social Assistance Payments Act , are entitled to IS. There is no age restriction for persons who are permanently unemployable or permanently incapable of work. Non -active women are eligible if older than 63 years3. The income threshold for entitlemen t is the sum of the MI for a person/family and the relevant amount of IS. For instance, in 2021, the income threshold for entitlement was EUR 591.20 (1.47 times the BAMI) for a single person or the first adult in the family; EUR 921 (2.29 times the BAMI) f or a family of two in which both members are eligible for IS; and EUR 732 (1.82 times the BAMI) for a family of two in which only one member qualifies for IS (e -UPRAVA, 2021b). If children are taken into account in determining the household MI, the thresho ld is increased by EUR 44.24 (0.11 times the BAMI). Income and assets are taken into account in the means test in the same way as for the CSA. Persons who are in full -time institutional care in a social welfare institution are not entitled to IS (Social As sistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). For other information on eligibility, the same applies as for CSA. Additional information is provided by MLFSAEO (2021c) and e -UPRAVA (2021b).  1.2  Coverage  On 1 December 2021, there were 99  332 CSA benefi ciaries (51  179 men and 46  568 women), of which 75  516 were aged 15 -65. There were also 22  468 IS beneficiaries (12 895 women and 9  573 men), of which 9  460 (4  913 men and 4 543 women) were aged 15 -65. In 2020, EUR 267  259  140 was spent on CSA and EUR 42  395 345 on IS (MLFSAEO, 2021c; MLFSAEO , 2021e).  The estimated take -up rate as a proportion of all those eligible is 90% for CSA and 85% for IS4. The strengths of the provision of income support are:   Both CSA and IS are granted from the first day of the mo nth that follows the application date, no matter how long the approval procedure lasts (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments );  In order to  accelerate the first payment, CSA is paid from the State budget twice a month: between the 3rd and 5th day and between the 18th and 21st day5. 1.3  Adequacy  The BAMI is used to set benefit levels (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). It is calculated on the basis of the minimum cost of living, but does not reach their level. The amount set in 2018 was the outcome of negotiations between the political and social partners. The method used to calculate  minimum costs of living  has no link to the concept of poverty used in the assessment of (the risk of) poverty. However, in all calculations (1997, 2009, 2017), this method resulted in the BAMI (for a single inactive person) that was close to the at -risk -of-poverty (AROP) thresho ld as defined by Eurostat (60% of the national equivalised  3 Men over 65 years of age are eligible.  4 Estimates obtained through consultation with Marjetka  Kovšca , MLFSAEO, on 19 November 2021.  5 Information collected through consultation with the MLFSAEO on 23 October 2021.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  6  household disposable median income) (Stanovnik and Stropnik, 1997; 1998; Stropnik et al ., 2009; Stropnik et al ., 2017; Stropnik, 2020).  The household is defined as including the claimant, their spo use or registered partner (including same sex partners), and their children and stepchildren (Exercise of Rights to Public Funds Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). CSA is the difference between the (household) MI and the applicant’s (household) income . The household MI is determined by attributing weights to the BAMI that are based on the types of person in a household: 1 for the first adult or a single person or an adult in institutional care; 1.26 for the first adult working 60 -128 hours per month; 1.5 1 for the first adult working 128+ hours per month; 0.7 for a single person aged 18 -26 registered as unemployed, with a permanent residence at the same address as their parents (or actually residing with them) who have sufficient own means of subsistence; 0.76 for a single person who is permanently unemployable or permanently incapable of work or older than 63 (female) or 65 (male), and has registered permanent or temporary residence at the same address as persons who are not their family members and have s ufficient means of subsistence, or actually resides with them; 0.57 for each further adult; 0.83 for each further adult working 128+ hours per month; 0.7 for each further adult working 60 -128 hours per month; 0.59 for a child the beneficiary is obliged to maintain. The MI is increased by 0.18 BAMI for each child living in a single -parent family when the other parent has died and the child is not receiving any related benefits, or the other parent is unknown, or when the child is not actually receiving maint enance benefits from the other parent (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). For instance , the MI for a two -parent family with one dependent child, where both parents work 128+ hours per month, is EUR 1  178.39 per month.  The amou nts of IS are: 0.47 BAMI for a single person or the first adult in the family (EUR  189.02 in 2021); 0.25 BAMI for every other adult in the family who is fulfilling the conditions (EUR 100.55 in 2021); and 0.55 BAMI for a single person who is permanently un employable or permanently incapable of work or non -employed and older than 63 years for women and 65 years for men, and who has permanent or temporary residence at the same address as persons who are not family members and have sufficient own means of subs istence, or actually resides with them (EUR 221.20 in 2021) (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). The amount of CSA is adjusted in parallel with the adjustment of the BAMI. The competent ministry must determine the minimum costs  of living every six years using a comparable methodology for the determination of minimum costs of living (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010; Stropnik et al ., 2009; Stropnik et al ., 2017; Stropnik, 2020). If the newly determined level of minimum costs of living is 15% (or more) greater than that on which the existing BAMI is based a new BAMI must be set. In the meantime, BAMI (and thus the CSA and SI) is indexed annually on 1 March by the inflation rate in the previous calendar year (Social Assistance P ayments Act, 2010).  Table 1 presents the relationship between the MI amount for a single person, a couple and families with children. The MI exceeds the national AROP threshold only in the case of a single -parent family with two or three children. It exce eds the extreme AROP threshold (40% of national median household disposable income) in all cases. The MI for a single -person household is lower than the net minimum wage. All other selected household types with income equal to the net minimum wage fulfil t he income condition for CSA.  Table 1.

Note: A single earner (in all cases) is working 128+ hours per month.  1.4  Links with other benefits  Extraordinary Cash Social Assistance  (izredna denarna socialna pomoč,  ECSA ) is a special form of CSA where it is established that the single person or family has found themselves in a situation of financial (material) deprivation due to circumstances beyond their control, or where they prove extraordi nary subsistence -related expenses that they are unable to cover with their own income. ECSA is granted either as a one -off benefit or for the period of three to six months. The monthly amount must not exceed the MI level for the individual/family, and the annual amount must not exceed five times the MI level for the individual/family (of which the triple MI may only be awarded for extraordinary expenses that are due to natural disaster or force majeure). The application must detail the purpose for which ECS A is needed and indicate the amount of funds needed. The beneficiary must submit evidence of the use of the funds to the SWC (Social Assistance Payments Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ), CSA beneficiaries and persons fulfilling the criteria for CSA (unless the applicant fulfils the conditions for IS) are exempt from co -payments (payment of the difference with the full cost  of health services  that is not paid through mandatory health insura nce but through complementary health insurance; pravica do kritja razlike do polne vrednosti zdravstvenih storitev ). These are covered from the central government budget (Exercise of Rights to Public Funds Act, 2010  and subsequent amendments ). Slovenian ci tizens are eligible, as are foreigners holding a permanent residence permit, with permanent residence in Slovenia, and covered by compulsory  health insurance (including their family members insured after them).  CSA beneficiaries and persons fulfilling the  criteria for CSA also have the right to the payment of contributions for compulsory health insurance from the central government budget (pravica do plačila prispevka za obvezno zdravstveno zavarovanje ; Exercise of Rights to Public Funds Act, 2010  and subs equent amendments ). The amount  paid is EUR 36.43 per person per month. Slovenian Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  8  citizens are eligible, as are foreigners holding a permanent residence permit, with permanent residence in Slovenia, who are not otherwise insured.  When a person exercises the ir right to CSA, the SWC decides on the right to both in -kind benefits (exemption from co -payments and payment of contributions for compulsory health insurance from the central government budget) ex officio , unless the person explicitly states in the appli cation that they do not exercise this right. This is an example of good practice.  2
