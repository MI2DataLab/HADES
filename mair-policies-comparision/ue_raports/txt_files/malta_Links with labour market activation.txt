Links with labour market activation  In respect of SA, the applicant must not be in employment and cannot register for work under Part 1 of the Unemployment Register. If a person decides to register for work, the SA is automatically changed to UA.  The lack of ability to work must be due to one of the following reasons:  a) medical reasons;  b) the need t o undertake care and custody of children, and is legally or de facto separated; or  c) be married, in a civil union, cohabiting or caring for  the spouse who may be critically ill. In this case the application is subject to approval by a Medical Board, appo inted in accordance with  the Social Security Act (Cap. 318).  In the case of UA, the conditions are different. A person who is benefiting from UA must be actively looking for work and as such be registered with JobsPlus, the public employment agency. Such a  person must participate in activation measures, such as training or job experience programmes, and not refuse job offers without an acceptable reason. In cases where medical conditions preclude a person receiving UA from working, the medical condition is periodically reviewed by a medical board. In cases where the individual is involved in substance abuse or other addictions, they need to attend a rehabilitation programme in order to receive the benefit. Failure to comply with these conditions may result i n the total loss of benefit.  As already  indicated  above,  in order  to wean  persons  off inactivity  and  social  benefits  and  provide  them  with  greater  security  in employment,  the Tapering  of Benefits  Scheme  was  introduced  in 2014 . Basically,  the scheme  provide s for a system  whereby  beneficiaries  drawing  SA or UA are allowed  to retain  part  of their  social  benefits  over  a three -year  period.  Tapering is applied to a person who is engaged in full -time employment, starts earning not less than the National Minimum Wa ge and would have been in receipt of a non -contributory benefit for a period of one year in the preceding three years. In these cases, the applicable benefit rates are as follows:   65% of the benefit rate for the first year   45% of the benefit rate for the s econd year   25% of the benefit rate for the third year.  In addition, 25% of the benefit rate paid is also paid to the employer for a period of 3 years.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strength s and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  9  Take -up of the scheme  gradually  peaked  to 3,600  in 2017  and  markedly,  over  80%  of the participants  remained  in employment  at the end  of the 3-year  period  of the scheme.  Around  70%  of participants  were  females8. The Tapering of Work Benefits scheme was part of a wider programme, labelled ‘Making  Work  Pay’.  In addition  to the tapering  system,  this  programme  also  comprises  the In-Work  Benefit  scheme  and  free  childcare  for parents  in employment  and  education.  However,  those  enjoying  the benefits  of the Tapering  of Work Benefits  scheme  are not entitled  to the In-Work  Benefit  scheme.  Strictly  speaking,  the In-Work  Benefit  (IWB)  scheme  is not part of any minimum income scheme. However, as a labour activation initiative, it was  conceived and tailored  to boost  the disposab le income  of dual -earner  families  and  single  parents  in employment  who  have  dependent  children  up to 23 years  of age , and particularly those earning the minimum wage . For this  reason,  official s at the Ministry  claim  that  the IWB  can be considered as being part and parcel of the Minimum Income Scheme in Malta.9 After  its launch  in 2014 , the scheme  was  extended  to one -earner  families  with  lower  rates  than  those  of dual -earners  to incentivize  the second  parent  to work  and  attain  a higher  benefit  rate.  NSO  reports  that  the number  of beneficiaries  during  the period  January -September  2021  had  increased  to 6,124, as compared to the same period during 2019, when the number of beneficiaries was 4,625. For the period January -September, total expenditure rose from €3, 136,000 in 2019 to €4,594,000 in 202110 To underpin  these  schemes  a free  childcare  service  was  also  rolled  out to facilitate  the entry  or retention  of women  in the labour  market.  The  Free  Childcare  Scheme  is a system  whereby  Government  provides  free  childc are services  to parents/guardians  who  work  or are pursuing  their  education  (not  just  UA beneficiaries).  The  childcare  service  is either  provided  directly  through  government  services  or alternatively  through  Registered  Childcare  Centres.  The  service  was  well received  by families  with  children  under  3, as underlined  by official  figures  indicating  that  from  the launch  of the service  in 2014  the number  of children  placed  in these  centres  doubled  to 6,700  11. These  social  activation  measures  contributed  towards  cutting  down  the number  of unemployed,  primarily  females,  to record  low levels  because  on taking  up employment,  previous  SA beneficiaries started to benefit from (a) the tapering of benefits programme and (b) free childcare facilities. They did not become SA beneficiaries after the 3 year period but stayed  on in full time -employment,  This  resulted  in a steady  increase  in the female  labour  market  participation,  thus  also  addressing  the gender  employment  gap.   The  success  of the package  is mirrored  by the significant  drop  in benefit  dependency  and  decrease  in the disincentive  to work.  In 2008, it was reported that  ‘45.0% of the 495 females applying for Social Assistance (SA) and Single Unmarried Parents (SUP) benefits were actively employed  on the day of application for benefits.  8 Anon.

The Journal.mt. https://thejournal.mt/how -malta -achieved -a-paradigm -shift -in-benefit -dependency/  9 According to  a statement made by Mr George Cremona, Director (Benefits Compliance). Ministry for the Family, Children's Rights and Social Solidarity, made on 14 March 2022, states: ‘It is important to note that the In Work Benefit Scheme is helping in keeping previous  social/unemployment assistance beneficiaries in an employment environment following the termination of the three -year period of the Tapering of Benefits payments. Hence, the IWB can be considered as being part and parcel of the Minimum Income Scheme pract iced by MT’   10 NSO News Release 196/2021 (27 October 2021). ‘Government Expenditure on Social Security Benefits: January – September 2021’.

After becoming el igible to benefits, this number dropped to circa 13.4 per cent. This is a clear example highlighting the disincentives within the current benefits structure12.’ As can be seen  from  Table  1, people  on SA decreased  from  9,241  in 2013  to just  under  4,600  at the end  of 2020;  and  UA beneficiaries  went  down  from  6,119  in 2013  to just  over  1,100  in 2020,  a decrease  of over  5,000 . This effectively means that in 2020, the  number of people on SA was only 50% of what it had been in 2013, whilst the number on UA was on ly 18% in 2020 of what it had been in 2013.   Table 1.

Expendit ure on Social Assistance 2013 -2020   Source: Official Communication NSO, 22 November  2021  The  above  table  illustrates  that  expenditure  on SA decreased  by over  41%  or €15m,  expenditure  on UA was  reduced  by 84%  or €19m.  The  reduction  in expenditure  on SA is due  to the huge  decrease  on social  assistance  dependency  which  may  in part  be due  to the measures  undertaken  during  a climate  of economic  growth  where  more  people  were  spurred  to join  the workforce.   What  is also  interesting  is that  during  the first  year  of the Covid -19 pandemic,  the number  of social  assistance  beneficiaries  remained  static  and  did not increase  as a result  of Covid -19 related  loss  of jobs,  as a result  of a series  of job retention  measures  implemented  in Malta  with  financial  support  from  the government.  3 Links to social services  and integrated provision of targeted social services  Malta’s state -run Foundation for Social Work Services (FSWS) incorporates a special agency, named Aġenzija Appoġġ  (AP) which functions as the national Agency for children, families and the community. AP safeguards and promotes the well -being of these persons through the development and provision of psycho -social welfare services. AP was not specifically set up to cat er for persons with minimum income, nor even persons who are at -risk -of-poverty or suffering material or severe material deprivation. But in its present form, AP provides services, all focusing on children, families and adults in vulnerable situations and/ or at risk of social exclusion. In line with Government policy AP offers services to support and work with families and/or individuals at risk of poverty and social exclusion to empower them to improve their quality of life through its social workers. It i s important to note however that these services are not outreach services but  are provided to people who drop in to seek them. (When requested to indicate action specifically aimed at MI beneficiaries for the present study, the official reply given was: ‘ clients are assessed irrespective if MI recipients or not ’. Thus,  these detailed data are not available.)  In parallel with the services provided by AP , the government run Foundation for Social Work Services (FSWS) runs a community based social services prog ramme which is  commonly known as LEAP13. This programme is specifically devoted to addressing Anti -Poverty and Social Exclusion issues in Malta and though not directly addressed at minimum income recipients supports many of them. The mission statement of L EAP is  13 It does not appear that LEAP is an acronym.
