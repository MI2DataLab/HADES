Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  The minimum income schemes in Germany form a complex categor icall y-based benefit system. Currently the German minimum i ncome system (MIS) includes four categor ical  schemes:  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   May, 2022  2   basic income support  for job -seekers (Grundsicherung für Arbeitsuchende ), under Social Code Book II ;  subsistence benefit  outside of institutions (Hilfe  zum Lebensunterhalt außerhalb von Einrichtungen ), under Sections 27 -40 of Social Code Book XII1;  basic income support in old age and in the event of reduced earning capacity (Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung ), under Sections 41 -46 of Soci al Code Book XII ; and   basic income  support for asylum -seekers under the Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act ( Regelleistungen nach dem Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz ). Minimum income benefits are the ultimate means of preventing people from falling into poverty . They  supplement the primary safety net of the social insurance and income maintenance system and provide means -tested financial support for those whose needs are not covered sufficiently by other resources. The y are intended to ensure a level of support which enables recipients to live ‘in human dignity ’ (according to Social Code Book XII) . At the same time, all schemes are designed in principle to help beneficiaries to mobilise their self -help capacities and to overcome their need for support.  The b asic income support  for job -seekers, targeted at people who are in need and capable of work ing, is, in particular,  aimed at helping them to (re)integrate into the labour market and find employment . All the MI schemes  are structured in the same way : there is an individual entitlement to social benefit for those in need and cannot meet their needs through their own effort or through social insurance benefits. At the same time, need s are assumed to be household -based, as applicants and family members liv ing with them are considered to form a claimant’s  household , sharing resources and meeting their needs together . All of the MI benefits are not subject to taxation.  Basic income support  for job -seekers under Social Code II is targeted at those of working -age ( from  15 to statutory retirement age) , who are capable of working , and their family members living in the same household . While those capable of working are entitled to ‘unemployment benefit II’ ( Arbeitslosengeld II ), family members not capable of working are entitled to the ‘social benefit’ (Sozialgeld) .   Subsistence benefit  under Social Code XII is aimed at people  below the statutory retirement age who are temporarily unable to work and provide inome support  for themselves and their families. Basic income support in old age and in case  of reduced earning capacity under Social Code XII is aimed at people  in need above  the standard retirement age2 and at those below  this age who are permanently incapa ble of work ing.  These benefits are com plemented by incme support under the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act, which is aimed at those who are in the process of seeking asylum . The focus below is on first two schemes , which  are of primary importance for people of working age  and those living with them.   1 Subsistence benefit  is also paid to those in institutional accommodation. Besides the provision made available by the facility concerned, this primarily includes clothing and pocket money for personal use. For adults, this is 27% of the standard benefit fo r an adult (Section 27b of Social Code  Book XII). Most beneficiaries of subsistence benefit in institutions also receive benefits from the “ basic income support in old age and in the case  of reduced earning capacity ” scheme, which cover their living expens es. In addition, there is further assistance for people in special need as part of social assistance, usually in the form of services and benefits in kind.  2 For those born before 1947, the standard retirement age was 65. For those born between 1947 and 1963, it is currently being raised in stages. For those born in 1964 or later, it is 67.

They are paid only to those whose household income and assets are below the minimum subsistence level.  In principle, receipt of subsistence benefit  under Social Code XII does not necessarily  require a formal application , local social welfare offices act ing on their own initiative when they become aware (e.g. through  neighbours or social workers ) of people in need . In practice, however, a wriiten application is needed to check pre -requisites and for documentation purposes3. In the case of basic income support  for job-seekers , claimants have  formally to complete a detailed aplication form and to go through a verification proce ss. In both cases, applicants are required  to provide all information and documents requested and to actively participate in clarifying any issues or queries that may ar ise The eligibility criteria  for both benefits are defined by l egisation  (in Social Code XII  for subsistance benefits , and in Social Code II  for basic income support  for job-seekers )4 in a similar way ,except that for basic income support for jobseekers, t here is an explicit reference to the labour market.  With a few exceptions, e very one who ha s their regular place of residence in the Federal Republic of Germany is entitled to basic income support  for job-seekers. This includes those born abroad, apart from for asylum -ssekers who have their own scheme. Those who have been resident in the country for less than three months and foreign citizens  who are not employed,  however, are not eligible5. The income and asset s of claimants are decisive in determining  their need for assistance. The legal requirements for means -testing  are similar  for both  schemes  but differ in detail. For both, almost all sources of income, whether regular or irregular, are taken into account in determining benefit entitlement. Only a few sources are excluded : in particular, basic pensions under the Federal Pensions Act (Bundesversorgungsgesetz ), pensions under the Federal Compensation Act (Bundesentschädigungsgesetz ), compensation payments for non -material damage, and nursing allowance s. Income is measure d in net terms, i.e. after deducting taxes, social and pension contributions and work -related expenses.  An earning s disregard is applied to income  from employment . For b eneficiaries of basic income support  for job-seekers  who are working , €100 of their monthly earned income  is left out of account when assessing their entitlement to benefit ; for earned income between €101 and €1,000, 20% is le ft out of acccount  and  for earned income between €1,001 and €1,200 (or €1,500 for  wage -earners with children ), 10%.  The maximum amount of earnings which is not taken into account is therefore €300 for wage -earners without children and €330 for those with children.  In the case of subsistence benefit, an amount equal to 30% of  earnings from employment, or self-employment , is not considered when assessing entitlement , up to a maximum of 50% of the standard benefit payble to a single adult.   3 Subsistence benefit  according to the third chapter of Social Code XI I is to be provided to people  who cannot , or cannot sufficiently , cover their necessary subsistence from their own efforts and means. The social assistance starts as soon as the social welfare office  become s aware that the requirements for the benefit are met . 4 For eligibility criteria in Social Code II and XII see in more detail (for example):  Berlit, Conradis  and  Pattar , 2019; Bieritz -Harder, Conradis  and  Thie , 2020; and Münder  and  Geiger , 2020.  5 More specifically, those not eligible consist of who : (1 ) are not employees or self -employed people  in Germany ; (2) are entitled to freedom of movement on the basis of Section 2 (3) of the Freedom of Movement Act/EU, but who have not yet resided in Germany for three months ; (3) do not have a right of residence , or have a  right of residence based solely on the purpose of seeking employment , or entered Germany in order to obtain basic income support for job -seekers ;. Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   May, 2022  4  There are also a few asset disrgards in the case of basic income support for jobseekers: a basic amo unt of at least €3,100 for each  adult and each child under 18; an additional €750 per person for essential purchases; an owner -occupied house/flat (up to a certain value ), private  entitlements  to old -age pension, other assets intended to provide for old age up to €750  per year of the life of those claiming benefit who are capable of working and their partner s, a car up to the value of €7,500 , appropriate furnishing s; and items essential for starting or continuing vocatio nal training or gainful employment . Further assets may also be disregarded if it is obviously uneconomic to liquidate them, as well as in cases of hardship.  For subsistence benefit under Social Code XII, the assets disregarded include any provided by publi c funds to build up or secure a livelihood or to establish a household ,; any derived from publicly funded old -age provision ;, an appropriate ly-sized  owner -occupied house or other property intended for residential purposes (for a family of four, a house or apartment of up  to 120 square metres is disregarded) , reasonable furnishing s, objects essential for beginning or continu ing vocational training or gainful employment , objects that serve to satisfy cultural needs  and which are not a luxury a nd a  small amount of cash (€5,000 per person under 18 , and €500 per child) . Any special hardship whch might be suffered by applicants is also taken into account.  As a result of the pandemic, amendments were made in March 2020 for a limited period – currently u p to end -December 2022, to make it easier to have access to both type s of MI benefit . The se include a temporary suspension of consideration of asset s (i.e. there is no check of assets during this period ), though this s does not apply if claimants have subs tantial assets , which, as a rule, means if the sum of immediately reali sable assets of the first household member exceeds EUR 60,000 and EUR 30,000 for each additional one  (Hanesch, Gerlinger 2021) . A feature of basic income support  for job -seekers is  a n obligation to actively participate in the procedures prescribed, which  is enforced by a set of sanctions , though a fter a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in November 2019 , these are limited to 30% of the standard rate of benefit applying at  the time. A reduction , however,  may not take place if this lead s to exceptional hardship (though as of March 2022, this was yet to be enshrined in a s tatutory  regulation).  The regulations for determining need s and the means -testing procedures for both MI benefits are not easy to understand for non -experts. According to a study by the Institute for Employment Research (Moczall et al ., 2017), low -skilled workers are sanctioned more often than hig her-skilled workers – regardless of their willingness to work.  One reason appears to be insufficient understanding of the rules and requirements. In addition, there is the risk that the application of sanction s– especially young people under age  25 – can  have counterproductive  effects  in the sense of deterring claims  (Van den Berg, Uhlendorf  and  Wolff , 2017 ). An important role i n helping claimants with their applications i s therefore played by independent counselling centres run by charitable organisations.   1.2  Coverage  Coverage of population groups  The system of minimum income schemes described above covers all , or nearly all  legally resident population groups at risk in Germany. Only apprentices and student  are formally excluded ,but these are entitled to benefits under the Employment Promotion Act or the Federal Training Assistance Act  In practice, however, there are certain groups that have a higher risk of failing to gain access to adequate support  than others . This is especially true of groups in extreme poverty who are affected by multiple forms of deprivation, such as  the homeless or those  with  addict ion problems .Although  these groups might have formal access to minimum income support, the specific nature of their needs and situation may mean that they are, in Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   May, 2022  5  many cases,  not covered in practice  (Mingot and Neumann, 2003; Sthamer, Brülle  and Opitz, 2013).  Non -take -up of minimum income benefits  Microsimulation studies have indicated significant non -take -up of  MI benefits  in Germany6. A recent study by Bruckmeier, Riphan and Wiemers (2019) estimated that the non -take -up rate of basic inco me support  for job-seekers was  35%  and higher for some groups , such people living alone without children (59%), and young people aged  15-24 (45%) , though it was  lower for single parents (30%). These results are in line with a number of previous  and later  studies  (see e.g. Beste  and  Trappmann , 2021; Koch , 2021 ). Empirical research  suggest s that applicants with income just below the minimum income threshold may fail to claim small amounts of benefit . If the expected duration of benefit receipt is short, thi s also seems to increase the probability of non -take -up. The same applies if claimant s are employed or if they are home -owner s (e.g. Bruckmeier et al ., 2013; Harnisch, 2019). There are many possible reasons for people failing to claim MI benefits  – a lack of knowledge of the ir entitlement , a calculation that in the case of them being entitled to only a small amount of benefit, making a claim may not be worthwhile , and being deterred by administrative procedures , as well as a fear of being stigmatised or loo ked down upon socially.  A recent experiment shows that fear of stigmatisation still prevents many people from claiming the benefits to which they are entitled (Friedrichsen and Schmacker, 2019).   Number and structure of beneficiaries  Some information on recipients of subsistence benetifs is available in the Federal Statistical Office database in 2018, the number in receipt was 121,511. In 2019 , it fell to 113,314 , and in 2020, it increased again to 119,860. In the  latter two years, just under 80% of recipients  were of working age (i.e. 18-64), the vast majority of them  are people living alone  (see Table 1 in Annex  1).  According to the database  of the Federal Employment Agency , the number of beneficiaries  of basic income support  for job-seekers fell from 5,795,000 in 2018 to 5,476,000 in 2019 and to 5,428,000  in 2020. These lived in 3,093,000  households  in 2018, 2,906,000  in 2019, and 2,903,000  in 2020  (implying there was an average of just under two beneficiaries per household) . In 202 0, 56% were single -person  households, 18% single -parent ones , 16% couples with children , and 9% couples without children. Some 3,889,000  beneficiaries were able to work and 1,539,000 not nable to (of  whom 1,488,000 were under 15). Men and women made up similar numbers of those capable of working . Foreign national accounted for 32% of beneficiaries , 18% of beneficiaris were 25, 64% 25 -54, and 32% 55 or over .  Among benefit recipients  capable of working , 1,58 7,000  (or 41%) were registered as unemployed,  933,000  (23%) were employed, and another 1,369,000 (36%) were inactive  – i.e. were neither working nor registered  as unemployed (Bundesagentur für Arbeit , 2021a ; see Table 2 in the annex  1). Those registered a s unemployed , the main target group for  activation measures, were  – and are - in the minority. Employed and other recipients of benefits who are capable of working are also regularly reviewed and have an opportunity of participating in integration measures  (see T able 2 in Annex 1) .  Duration of benefit receipt  People receiving income support for job seekers, who were long -term recipients of benefit, as defined in Social Code II  - i.e. those receiving benefit for at least 21 months in the previous 24  – numbered 2,675,000 in the period September 2019 to August 2020  (69% of the total of 3,868,000 ). The proportion concerned, though  6 Unfortunately, no studies or findings are available on subsistence benefit . Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   May, 2022  6  fluctuating a little) has remained at around this level  over the past decade (Bundesagentur für Arbeit,  2021a).   1.3  Adequacy  Income support elements  Basic income support  for job-seekers and subsistence benefit  include the following elements:   a standard benefit  covering what is regarded as the current minimum subsistence for food, clothing, personal care, furnishings, electricity, healthcare, and everyday personal needs ;  fixed allowances to meet the additional requirements of certain groups (such as single parents) ;  one -off payments to meet specific needs (a few one -off payments are listed in the legislation; beneficiaries can apply for loans to cover additional needs);   benefits for education and social participation  – a package of mainly non -cash benefits are directly aimed at increasing the participation of children and young people in recipient households in  education and social life;  coverage of housing and heating costs to a reasonable extent (see below) ;   coverage in the case of basic income support for jobsekers of   contributions to compulsory statutory health and long -term care social insurance schemes  (but old-age pension contributions)7.  (2) Standard benefit  (a) Method of setting the benefit level  According to Section s 20 and 23  Social Code Book II, the level and structure of the standard basic income support  benefit for job-seekers takes account of  how it is defined under Social Code Book XII. Since January 2011, the level of the subsistence benefit under the latter has been legally defined by the ‘Standard Benefit Determination Law’  (Regelbedarfsermittlungsgesetz ). The standard benefit payable under Social Code Books II and XII is determined by the ‘statistical standard method’ , which means that it is calculated on the basis of the level and pattern  of consumer expeniture in lower -income households , as measured by the ‘income and consump tion sample survey’ (ICS). The method is applied every 5 years, when new data from the ICS  become available – most recently with the Standard Benefit Determination Law  of 9 December 2020. In the intervening years, benefits are updated annually according to a combined price and wage index, with a weight of 70%  attached to price changes and  one of 30% to change s in the net wages and salaries of those  statutorily insured.  The benefit amounts fixed in this way are the same for both minimum income benefit scheme s. In 202 2, the monthly amounts are set out below :  Single person or single parent  €449   Couple , per head    €404   Non-working adult under 25  living with their parents   €360   Young people aged 14-17   €376   7 Since 2011, recipients of unemployment benefit II have no longer been covered by the statutory pension insurance scheme. Contributions to private pension plans are also not covered. However, entitlements to old -age provision are  a protected asset.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   May, 2022  7   Child aged 6-14   €311   Child aged 0-5             €285  The elements listed above are added to these standard amounts to give the total benefit entitlement , though the actual amount payable depends on a household’s existing resources.  The procedure for deriving the standard benefit as described a bove has been the subject of debate for many of years, with questions raised about the determination of the reference group, the procedure for avoiding circular reasoning , and the  exclusion of ‘non -relevant ’ consumer goods8. However, the Federal Constitut ional Court has examined the procedure on a number of occasions, the last time in 2014, and has concluded that it is appropriate.  Nevertheless, as studies have shown, the level of basic income support for jobseekers is in most cases well below the household -specific at-risk -of-poverty poverty threshold  conventionally used in the EU  (see e.g. Tophoven, Wenzig  and  Lietzmann , 2015; Ha nesch , 2016; and  Beste, Bethmann  and  Gundert , 2014 , and , most recently, Konle -Seidl , 2021).    (2) Costs of accommodation and heating  A second important p art of the two minimum income benefit schemes, in addition to the standard benefits, is the reimbursem ent of  the actual costs of housing and heating . According to Section 22 of Social Code Book II , reimbursement cover s the amount of the two which is ‘reasonable ’, taking account of the circumstances in the local housing market. Any rent or costs which exceed this has to be paid by the recipients themselves9. The application of ‘reasonableness’, howeer, has been waived as part of the temporary easing of access to minimum income benefits in response to the Covid pandemic, so that the actual costs o f  housing and heating are covered up until 31 December 2022. (Hanesch, Gerlinger 2021) . Outside of this temporary period, municipal authorities responsible for the provisi on of minimum income benefits have some discretion over what housing and heating cost s are covered. Accordingly , the implementation of th e regulation concerned varies greatly between the m. The decision on the adequacy of housing and heating costs is the responsibility of the municipalities . According to the Federal Social Court  case law , the municipalities must present a conclusive overall concept , which should be based  on regularly updated surveys of the local housing market . A recent study (Malottki et al ., 2017) , however,  has shown that one in five municipalities make no attempt to develop such a method , but instead use the maximum amount table in Section 12 of the Housing Benefit Act10. Perhaps as result, the decisions made by municipalities on the costs to cover are often disputed and lead to appeals and lawsuits11.   1.4  Links with other benefits  There are no other benefits which recipients of basic income support  for job -seekers and subsistence benefit are entitled to, other than the reimbursement of housing and heating costs, which are an integr al part of the two schemes (and which in oth er countries may be separate from minimum income benefits as such) .   8 See, for example, Becker ,(2011  and  2016 ); Becker  and  Held (2020 ); Aust, Rock  and  Schabram  (2020 ); Aust , (2020).  9 Or they have to move to an apartment whose costs are below this limit.  10 A crucial difference between housing allowance and coverage of housing co sts according to Social Code II and XII is that housing allowance only provides a subsidy and the remaining costs have to be covered by the beneficiary, whereas coverage of costs according to the Social Code is supposed to cover the total amount, since no own resources are available .. 11 In December 2019, one in five of all lawsuits before the social courts involved conflicts over the coverage of accommodation costs  (Bundesagentur für Arbeit , 2020) .
