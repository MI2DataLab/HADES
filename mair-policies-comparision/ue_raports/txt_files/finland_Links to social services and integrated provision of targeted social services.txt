Links to social services and integrated provision of targeted social services  All people receiving MI benefits are entitled to the same social care and healthcare services, education, training, and rehabilitation as the rest of the population. Thus, in principle, the coverage is 100%. However, non -active people are not entitled to occupational healthcare, which is free of charge and more easily accessible than services at healthcare centres, which charge service fees and usually have longer queues for treatment.  Furthermore, unmet medical needs due to costs are in Finland higher than  the EU -26 average. The problem is most severe among the lowest income quintile (OECD , 2020a).  The integration of income transfers and various services is not always seamless and there are municipal variations in the supply of, and access to, services (Kan gas & Kalliomaa -Puha, 2020; Saikkonen & Ylikännö, 2020).  Take up -rates  of services  In principle, all of the target population is covered. However, the take -up rate remains rather low.  LMS:  in 2020, 116,672 of the total 431,978 LMS recipients also receive d some benefits  related to active labour market policies8. Thus, the average take -up rate was  27% (Kelasto, 2021a). Among those who ha d received  the LMS for less than 100 days , the take -up rate was  about 50% ; but thereafter it drop ped  rapidly  and was  15-20% among those who ha d been unemployed longer than one year.  Basic social assistance : In 2020, there were 417,071 recipients of basic social assistance; Kela sent municipalities about 33,000 notifications (about 10% of all cases) on: Of these, 23,000 were  applications for supplementary or preventive social assistance  and the rest concerned 1) unemployed people under 25 who had received   received social assistance as the main source of income  for longer than four months , 2) older unemployed people who had received  social assistance as the main source of income for longer 12 months , 3)  notifications of clients with reduce d basic amount of social assistance and  4) notifications of clients in need of social services  . In   cases 1 and 2, the joint activation process (see Section 2) between  municipality and TEO may be initiated (Kelasto, 2021b).   8 During participation in employment -promoting services, unemployment benefit can be paid at an increased  rate for up to 200 days.
