Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  For many years, Greece was  one of very few EU Member States without a comprehensive social assistance scheme providing income support of last resort to individuals and families (Lalioti, 2016; Matsaganis, 2018 and 2020; Lalioti and Koutsampelas, 2021). This has changed in recent years. First ly, a Guaranteed Minimum Income  (GMI) scheme was pilote d under the name of Guaranteed Social Income for six months (November 2014 – May 2015) in 13 municipalities. Th at was followed by a slightly different scheme , Social Solidarity Income , which was initially launched in 30 municipalities (July 2016 – January 2017) and then subsequently rolled out nationwide from February 2017. In September 2019, it was renamed the GMI . Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  2  The programme supports the incomes of vulnerable individuals and households by providing cash assistance equal to the difference between a bene ficiary’s assessed income and the guaranteed level. In addition to income support, the GMI has two other  pillars: Pillar 2 aims to connect beneficiaries with other social programmes and services available at national and local level, while Pillar 3 aims to  (re)integrate beneficiaries into the labour market.  Beneficiary units can be single adults living alone (except  students – see below)  or multi -person households consisting of individuals living under the same roof, including adult children up to the age o f 25 if in tertiary education regardless of their place of residence. The homeless are also eligible , provided they are registered with municipal social services1. Individuals in residential care, assisted living, transitional housing, rehabilitation, mon asteries, and prisons cannot apply for the programme.  The guaranteed level of income depends on a household’s size and composition: it is EUR 200 per month for the household head, EUR 100 for each additional  adult, and EUR 50 for each child. In single -parent households, the first child counts as an adult , thus the guaranteed amount for a mother with two minor children is EUR 350 per month. A ceiling of EUR 900 per month is set as the maximum payable, irrespec tive of household composition.  Those applying for the programme can do so in person, at a municipal or community centre , or online2. Homeless people, households with guests3, single -parent families, and those with unprotected children can only apply in person at a municipal or community centre, with their supporting documentation.  Applicants (or a municipal or community centre employee on an applicant’s behalf) enter their credentials , using their social security number and tax identification number . The GMI information system then automatically pre -fills part of the GMI application form with information from their latest tax return on the  tax authority database ( taxisnet ). Furthermore,  the IT platform cro ss-links electronically in “real time” information from several  state databases . Other i nformation that is not available from the  above databases  tax returns  (e.g. education level ) must be filled in by the applicant.   If all pre -filled information is up to date and consistent with official databases, then the applicant can submit the application form and automatically see the outcome (approved/rejected). I f there are inconsistencies, a notification appears , highlighting  ‘missing ’ or ‘incorrect’ information, and asking the applicant to visit a municipal office or community centre4. These notifications are based on programme rules described in the Joint Ministerial Decree.  Once an application is submitted, the applicant is informed of whether or not it is accepted . If it is  accepted , the GMI benefit amount to be awarded is also notified. The first payment takes place one month after the application. After a six -month period, beneficiar ies must reapply and be reassessed.  Beneficiaries are obliged to :   File an annual tax return ;  1 In September 2021, 3.5% of all beneficiary units were homeless.  2 https://keaprogram.gr/pubnr/Account/Login   3 ‘Guests’ are persons living in the household who are not classified as dependants for tax purposes. For instance, an adult (over the age of 25) non -disabled child who still lives in the parental home is no longer a dependant and is classified as a ‘guest’.  4 For example: ‘you are a single -parent family, so you must submit your application t hrough the municipal office’, or ‘you are a guest in the household, thus your application will not be approved’, or ‘you have not filled in your IBAN’, etc.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  3   Consent to a ‘social investigation’ (a home visit by municipality/community centre officials for on -site verification of the household’s composition and living conditions) ;  Ensure that all children in  the household go to school, up to the compulsory education level (normally age 15) ;  Participate in the primary school diploma examinations, or enrol in a second chance school ( on invitation - if aged 18 -45 years and not in possession of a compulsory educa tion certificate) ;  Attend for psychosocial support or professional counselling (on invitation) ;  Register with the Public Employment Service  (PES) , renew their unemployment status, attend job counselling, participate in training and other activation programmes ( e.g. e ntrepreneurship support), and accept suitable job offers (if able to work5);  Not quit their job without justification ;  Inform the authorities of all changes in their emplo yment status or earnings, and declare that information in the following year’s tax return.  The GMI payment is automatically suspended if electronic cross -checks reveal discrepancies. Beneficiaries are notified by email or text message, and given two months to provide additional documentation. Payment is also s uspended if children in the household are not enrolled or are absent from  school without justification . The household may reapply for GMI after a period of six months, subject to the child’s enrolment in school in the new school year.  1.1  Eligibility  The Join t Ministerial Decree of January 2017  (revised in June 2018 and again in July 2021 ) sets out eligibility criteria for the GMI:  1. Income  Definition: household net disposable income, assessed on the basis of the previous year’s tax return. (Claimants are requir ed to disclose changes in their circumstances in the intervening period.)  Income ceilings: Household net disposable income, assessed over a period of  six months prior to the application, may not exceed the guaranteed amount for that type of household (for example, EUR 200 per month for a single -person household or EUR 400 per month for a couple with two children). An overall ceiling of EUR 900 per month applies , regardless of the number of household members.   Income excluded : a) 20% of labour earnings (including in the context of public work schemes) ; b) disability benefit s; c) daily allowances to unemployed workers in vocational training ; d) financial aid to victims of natural disasters ; e) total earnings of victims of domestic violence or homeless  persons for two years after their reintegration to the labour market.  2. Assets  Definition:  Household assets are assessed on the basis of the previous year’s tax return. (Claimants are required to disclose changes in their circumstances in the intervening pe riod .) Real estate: The total taxable value of the household’s housing wealth may not exceed EUR 90  000 for a single -person household, increased by EUR 15  000 for each additional household member, subject to an overall ceiling of EUR 150  000.   5 Ability to work is defined as age 18 -65, excluding students and people with disabilities.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  4  Capital incom e: The total income earned by household members on bank deposits in Greece or abroad may not exceed the relevant threshold (EUR 4  800 for a single -person household, increased by EUR 2  400 for each additional adult and by EUR 1  200 for each child, up to an overall ceiling of EUR 14  400), multiplied by a notional interest rate set by the Bank of Greece.  Passenger cars: The imputed annual taxable income6 corresponding to passenger cars owned by the household may not exceed EUR 6  000.  Luxury tax: Households pa ying the luxury tax, or paying t uition fees to private schools, wages to car drivers, yacht crew members, private tutors, and other domestic personnel, are ineligible for the GMI.  3. Residence:  Eligible households must be legally and permanently domiciled in Greece. Temporary residents are not eligible, thereby excluding asylum seekers and refugees immigrants not granted permission to stay permanently. Foreign nationals  who meet all other conditions may be immediately eligible for the GMI on obtaining legal an d permanent residence7. Approximately one -sixth of all GMI recipients are not Greek citizens.  1.2  Coverage  According to the latest official data, the re were 231  395 household GMI recipients in September 2021 , covering 426  637 individuals (approximately 3.9% of the population in 2020). The average size of beneficiary units was low , at 1.84 pe ople . Over half of all beneficiary units (55%) were single -person households, followed by two -person households (22%) . Only 3% of all beneficiar ies had  5+ household members. Families with children accounted for 23% of GMI beneficiar ies, one -third (8%) of which were single -parent households. Approximately 73% of all beneficiaries were of working age (16-64).  Table 1  shows the decline in the absolute numbe r of GMI recipients since the programme’s introduction in February 2017. Th at decline corresponded to 19% in household terms, and as much as 39% in individual terms. The average size of beneficiary units fell accordingly, from 2.46 in 2017 to 1.84 in 2021.  The decrease in GMI recipient numbers can be somewhat attributed to the general improvement in economic outlook, which has led to a significant decrease in the population living in poverty. However, the former fell faster than the latter. As a result, the  share of GMI recipients of the population living in poverty declined from 71% to 54%  (40% of median equivalent household disposable income) , or from 32% to 22% (60% of median equivalent household disposable income).   Table 1.  GMI recipients, total population, and population living in poverty (2017 -2021)   2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  GMI recipients        6 The formula applied by the tax authorities for the calculation of the (presumptive) imputed annual taxable income corresponding to a passenger car is a function of engine size (in cm3) and age. For example, the EUR  6 000 ceiling applies to a relatively new car  (<5 years) equipped with a 1  533 cm3 engine, or to an older car (5 -10 years) equipped with a 1  962 cm3 engine.  7 This contrasts sharply with the residence requirement for access to child benefit and housing benefit, which exclude non -EU nationals until they have been legally and permanently domiciled for five years (prior to 2020), and now for 12 years, under the pr ovisions of Law 4659/2020. Technically. GMI applicants must present an income tax return, which implies that they must have obtained legal residence at least one year prior to applying for GMI.

Data on GMI recipients for October 2017, December 2018, May 2019, March 2020, and September 2021.  To date, t he only study of coverage and take up of the GMI was carried out by the World Bank in 2018 (Marini et al., 2019), That impact evaluation report  set the poverty threshold at 40% of median equivalent househ old disposable income  and estimated that  the GMI programme had a vertical targeting efficiency rate of about 80% (i.e. only 20.4% of recipients were located above the 40% poverty threshold), and a horizontal targeting efficiency rate of 34.0% (i.e. as many  as two -thirds of the population below the  40%  poverty threshold were not in receipt of the GMI). Setting the poverty threshold at 60% of the median implied a vertical targeting efficiency rate of over 93% (only 6.9% of recipients were located above that t hreshold), and a horizontal targeting efficiency rate of 10.2% (i.e. the GMI failed to reach nine -tenths of the population below the 60% poverty threshold).  Low coverage may be the result of three factors.  1. Stringent i ncome and asset criteria. Budgetary con straints and the need to preserve work incentives have led the government to set the income threshold (and the MI guarantee) at a rather low level: EUR 200 per month for a single person and EUR 400 per month for a couple with two children correspond to 27%  and 26% of median household disposable income for these two household types , respectively. In a country with  high rates of owner -occupation, and notwithstanding the decline in house prices in the early 2010s, the thresholds for housing wealth  (EUR 90  000 and EUR 135  000 for a single person and a couple with two children , respectively ) may disqualify a considerable number of claimants who pass the income test but fail the asset test. What matters here is the joint  distribution of income and wealth: the inco me-poor/asset -rich are just as ineligible for the GMI as the income -rich/asset -poor (with the thresholds dividing ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ set rather low , as outlined above).  2. Stringent r esidence criteria (although not as stri ct as other social benefits). More s pecifically, in order to be allowed to apply for the GMI non -EU citizens must be in possession of a permanent residence permit. Temporary residence permit holders  and undocumented migrants are ineligible for the GMI.  3. Non -take -up may be significant (although the available evidence remains  circumstantial). Marini et al. (2019) found that ‘only 37 % of households in the first decile are currently receiving the benefit, even  though […] the program me’s income eligibility criteria should ensure coverage of all households Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  6  in the first decile and of a portion of households in the second decile ’ (p.3) . Analysing non -take -up in greater depth, the 2019 World Bank report estimated that of the 63% of households in the first decile not in receipt of the GMI, most had failed to apply (rather than having their application rejected). At first sight, this appears to constitute prima facie  evidence of non -take -up. ‘A sizeable portion of thes e (about one -quarter , or 15 % of households in the first decile) had never heard of the program me, and half (or 31 % of households in the first decile had heard about the SSI but did not know any detail and hence never applied ’ (Marini et al., 2019, p.9). On closer inspection, this may not necessarily be the case: ‘11% of households in the first decile reported being familiar with the program me but chose not to apply for various reasons (mostly because they thought they would not qualify); one can only specul ate that such households may have informal sources of income and wanted to avoid scrutiny by applying for a welfare program me. Asset filters may also be playing a role in the lower -than -expected coverage of the first decile ’ (Marini et al., 2019, pp.9 -10). Given that the World Bank study  was carried out only one year after t he launch of the programme, it is likely that knowledge of its availability has since improved . Local administrators at municipalities and community centres are known to inform vulnerabl e residents about the programme . However, the number of recipients has fallen faster than the number of people living in poverty, which suggests that the problem of low coverage may  in fact  have become more acute.  1.3  Adequacy  In 2020 , the rate of the GMI (i.e. the maximum benefit payable to those with no resources  of their own ) corresponded to 27% of median household disposable income for a single person (26% for a couple with two children). As a share of the poverty threshold, the si ngle -person rate was 46% ( 60%  threshold) or  68% ( 40% t hreshold). In the case of a couple with two children, the GMI rate s were 43% and 65% of the respective poverty threshold ( all figures on an annual basis) . Table 2 shows  that the level of the GMI for a c ouple with two children was double that of unemployment assistance benefit (payable only to long -term unemployed workers aged 45 -64), approximately equal to 69% of the level of unemployment insurance benefit, and to 48% of the level of the statutory minimu m wage. (All figures are for a single -earner household, including allowances for dependents, on an annual basis). For a single person, the GMI rate compare d less favourably with the minimum wage (26%) and unemployment insurance benefit (45%), while it was exactly equal to the level of unemployment assistance benefit (for long -term unemployed workers aged 45-64).

The programme accounts for a significant share of resources commanded by the target population. Marini et al. (2019) estimated that the GMI provide d 69% of the aggregate income of households in the first decile, and one -third of the aggregate income of households below the 40% poverty threshold.  Indexation is ad hoc  and has yet to happen, i.e. the GMI level has not been adjusted since the programme was launched  in February 2017 . In 2020, as a special provision related to emergency income support in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic , GMI recipients with children received a one -off lump sum of EUR 100 for the first child, and EUR 50 for ea ch subsequent child, up to a maximum of EUR 300.  1.4  Links with other benefits  GMI acts as a ‘passport benefit ’ for a number of other schemes, with GMI r ecipients also eligible for additional benefits or subsidies, which are awarded either automatically or on application. These are:   Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived ( FEAD ; in Greek – TEBA) : GMI recipients may opt to receive food and basic goods , with an estimated 80% of all GMI recipients receiving this extra support ;  Social tariff: GMI recipients are eligible to apply for a discount on their electricity bills. In 2018, about 46% of all households (58% of all individuals ) in receipt of GMI also benefited from the social tariff. Marini et al. (2019) estimated that the di scount implicit in the social tariff for GMI recipients (about 85% of the normal tariff) was worth EUR 82.50 for an average consumption of 1,100 kWh over a four -month period ;  Social dividend: in place since 2014, t his is a discretionary lump -sum transfer paid at the end of the year to a list of beneficiaries (usually low -income pensioners, the unemployed , etc.). According to Marini et al. (2019), some 70% of GMI recipients received the social dividend in 2017. In 2020, GMI recipients were added to that year ’s list of those eligible for the s ocial dividend (equal to the value of an extra monthly payment). This was expected to be the case in 2021  also;   Free entry to cultural sites: GMI beneficiaries may visit a range of museums and archaeological sites free of  charge.  Income from housing benefit and disability benefits is excluded from the income assessed when applying for the GMI. According to September 2021  data , the share of GMI beneficiary units with a disabled member was 4.3%  (1.3% at individual level). To date, no data are available on the joint distribution of GMI recipients and housing benefit recipients. The total number of households that received housing benefit in 2020 was 241  154.  Conversely, income from the GMI is excluded from income assessed when applying for all other social benefits (including housing benefit and child benefit).  2 Links  with labour market activation  Policies aimed at (re)integrating beneficiaries into the labour market (Pillar 3) were slow to develop  and activation of GMI recipients remains limited. However , given the lack of employment opportunities, even  better -designed activation policies and stricter sanctions may have had little effect on the employment rate of GMI recipients. Unemployment in Greece re mains the highest in the EU , at 16.1% in the second quarter of 2021, down from 27.5% in the same quarter of 2013.  The original GMI legislation emphasised labour market activation , obliging GMI recipients  to collaborate with the PES  and imposing sanctions f or non -compliance. Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  8  However, the provisions were not properly enforced, primarily due to limited capacity at the PES . Following a pilot phase, the nationwide roll out of Pillar 3 policies was officially launched in June 2021. A Joint Ministerial Decree of Ju ly 2021 also aimed to strengthen the labour market activation of GMI recipients. The main provisions in force are:   All adult members of a household in receipt of the GMI who are able to work are expected to register with the (PES; in Greek  - ΟΑΕΔ ) within one  month of approval of their application for the GMI. About 51% of all GMI recipients  (70% of those aged 15 -64) are now registered with the PES . About 24% of all working -age recipients are in work, 3% are incapable of working, and the remaining 3% are self -reported unemployed but not yet registered with the PES ;  Once registered, GMI recipients are obliged to attend their local PES branch when invited to do so, to accept any suitable job offer , and to participate in activation programmes such as t raining, job counselling or entrepreneurship support. Those younger than 45 who have not finished compulsory education must pass  – if invited - elementary school final exam ination s or enrol in second -chance schools ;  As of 1 June 2021, approximately up to 4 500 new  recipients  per month , upon prioritization,  must attend an interview with an employment counsellor at the PES to assess their skills (‘profiling’). They are then expected to sign up to an Individual Action Plan, drawn up with their employment couns ellor . Existing recipients are expected to do this  when their application is reassessed. The Plan commits the individual to accepting reasonable job offers or invitations to participate in training ( a similar provision applies to registered unemployed work ers who do not receive the GMI) ;  In theory, non -compliance with these obligations can lead to exclusion from the scheme, with reapplication possible only after the obligations have been fulfilled . These sanctions were deferred to  October 2021  January 2022 . In practice, the role of sanctions is constrained by the capacity of  the local PES , which must first invite recipients to accept a job offer, participate in training or an activation programme, sign up to an Individual Action Plan, enrol in a  second -chance school , etc. P rogress is being made , however: data from  September 2021 show that over 32% of all GMI recipients registered with the PES had signed up to an Individual Action Plan, while nearly 9%  had participated in an active labour market p rogramme.  As an extra inducement, GMI beneficiaries have been designated a ‘priority group’ in some activation programmes (vocational training, public work and internship schemes, hiring subsidies). GMI recipients are assigned extra points in the scoring s ystem for selecting participants, a s well as a higher rate or a longer duration of subsidy.  GMI benefit is paid as a fixed -term award for a period of six months. Recipients transitioning to employment continue to receive the same amount of GMI benefit unti l the six -month term expires. At that time , and assuming the recipient informs the programme administrators of the change in circumstances resulting from being employed, their primary income is reassessed and GMI benefit adjusted or  discontinued, as approp riate.  3
