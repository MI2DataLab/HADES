We do not have any counterfactuals to perform the evaluation. One way to overcome this problem would be to compare outcomes in different countries (i.e. different social policy systems) in terms of poverty -reduction and poverty levels at different levels of poverty thresholds. According to Eurostat (2021a and 2021), the AROP rate before income transfers in Finland was about the same level as the average for the 27 EU Member States (25.1% and 25.4%, respectively); whereas after income transfers were receive d, the Finnish AROP rate was lower than the EU -27 average (12.1% vs 17.1%). Consequently, the poverty -reduction rate was greater in Finland (52%) than in the EU on average (33%). Furthermore, the relative median AROP poverty gap in Finland (13.7%) was the second lowest in the EU (EU average 24.2%; Euro stat 2021c). The comparative data show that the Finnish social benefits system as a whole works comparatively well.  Table 2.

Poverty -alleviation (%) = (poverty after MI transfers – poverty before MI transfers) / (poverty before MI transfers) *100 ( source: Honkanen, 2021).  The downside is that there are often work disincentives, which may contribute to long -term unemployment. However, the main problem is elsewhere. As the OECD (2020b) publication Faces of Joblessness Finland shows , 70% of the Finnish population lack ing stabl e employment face multiple employment barriers , and 40% face three barriers or more. The activation measures are therefore not always as effective as wished  for. The OECD recommendation was for more targeted measures that are better tailored to meet the ne eds of people facing  several barriers.  Similar conclusions were drawn from the Finnish basic income experiment, which ran during 2017 -2018 (Ylikännö & Kangas, 2021). When health problems form a barrier to employment, the conditionality of a social benefit  is not a relevant issue. To enhance re-employment possibilities and further activation of citizens, services are needed. In Finland, the TEOs offer services to unemployed job -seekers, as well as municipal health and social services, and education services . The emphasis in these services is on the transition towards more intensified multi -disciplinary work in a customer -oriented manner. Decent economic security is necessary, but is not a sufficient condition for re -employment. Income transfers must be accom panied by a wide array Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  14  of services to improve the employability of those who have multiple barriers to employment (Saikkonen & Ylikännö, 2020).  In order to improve the efficacy of the activation measures, more detailed data on the participation rates and e ffectiv eness of the measures are needed.
