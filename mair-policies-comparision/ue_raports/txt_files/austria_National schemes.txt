Description of national schemes providing minimum income support  This report deals with  different schemes of social protection.  There is means -tested minim um income  (MMI; Bedarfsorientierte Mindestsicherung ) or social assistance  (SA; Sozialhilfe ), which is mainly – irrespective of some earlier and current attempts at national co -ordination – the responsibility of the federal provinces ( Bundesländer ). The rep ort also addresses unemployment assistance  (UA; Notstandshilfe ), which is a benefit funded and provided by the unemployment insurance system, and which can be obtained once the maximum duration of unemployment benefit (UB; Arbeitslosengeld ) has been reache d. UA can – in principle – be received for an indefinite time. It therefore to some degree (and more so than in many other countries) substitutes for the minimum income scheme in the narrow sense, which is MMI/SA.  Between 2010 and 2019 the minimum income s cheme in the narrow sense was usually called MMI , which  replaced the earlier scheme called SA (Fink 2015; Fink/Leibetseder 2019 ; Woltran 2019; Natili 2019, 283ff. ). This resulted from an agreement between the Federal Republic and the federal provinces, cal led the “treaty according to §15a of the Austrian constitution” (hereafter: “15a treaty”), which outlined the most important features, basic principles and minimum standards of the MMI.2 At the same time legislative responsibility remained with the federa l provinces, each of which had its own legislati on on minimum income. The 15a treaty expired at  the end of 2016, and the Federal Republic and the federal provinces could not find a compromise on a renewed agreement. This meant that competency for the MMI scheme then was in principle again completely located at the level of the federal provinces , and that the short period of formal co -ordination had come to an end. However, in spring 2019 the national centre -right coalition government of the Austrian People’s Party ( ÖVP ) and the Austrian Freedom Party ( FPÖ ) introduced the  Basic Social Assistance A ct (Sozialhilfe -Grundsatzgesetz3). However, unlike  the earlier 15a treaty, the Basic Social Assistance Act does not define minimum standards, but  2 For the full text of  the treaty  and additional parliamentary material  see:  https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/I/I_00677/index.shtml . 3 BGBl.

Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  3  instead sets  maximum standards that  may not be exceeded  by the minimum income schemes of the federal province s. The Act came into effect on 1 June 2019 and the federal provinces were expected to adapt their legislation on minimum income by the end of 2019. However, several of them were reluctant to do so, due (amongst other things)  to a case  then before  the Const itutional Court ( Verfassungsgerichtshof ). In December 2019 the court overrode  parts of the Basic Social Assistance Act (amongst other things maximum benefit levels for children) on the grounds that they  violat ed the constitution.4 By November 2021 six fed eral provinces (Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, and Vorarlberg) had changed their legislation on MMI/SA  to bring it into line with  the Basic Social Assistance Act.5 But i n Vienna only parts of the act had been  implemented6, and  in Tyrol and Burgenland no major changes  had been  made .7 As part of this reform, in many federal provinces the earlier MMI was also renamed, back to the term used before 2010, which is SA.  Because the Basic Social Assistance Act defines maximum rather than minimum standards, there is no national minimum standard across the nine federal provinces, and benefits are regulated differently across federal provinces. For this reason, the following sections try to describe general principles and give, wh ere necessary, concrete examples from two federal provinces, namely Vienna and Lower Austria. These federal provinces are  selected because a comparatively high share of MMI /SA recipients lives there ( at yearly average around  66% in Vienna and 7% in Lower Austria) ,8 and because Vienna has relatively genero us benefits, whereas Lower Austria is more on  the restrictive side.  Unlike MMI/SA, unemployment insurance (and therefore also UA) is the sole responsibility of the Federal Republic. Information on UA give n below therefore applies to the whole country without regional differentiation.  Spending on MMI/SA amounted to €959.2 million gross in 2020.9 Net spending for UA was €1,868.86 million in 2020 ( Arbeitsmarktservice  2021, 79).  Some changes to UA were introduced because of COVID -19. The UA benefit level was temporarily increased to th at of UB, retroactively from 16 March 2020 and until September 2020. This regulation was repeatedly extended until the end of September 2021. . Furth ermore, until the end of January 2022 three  one -off lump -sum payments for recipients of UB and  UA were granted in the context of COVID -19.10  In the same context, resources of the Hardship fund for families have been used to provide additional financial su pport to parents with children , who have been in receipt of MMI/SA  in 2020  (50 Euros per child per month for maximum two months). In 2021 ,  4 For  the full text of t he decision by the Constitutional Court see: https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Vfgh/JFT_20191212_19G00164_00/JFT_20191212_19G00164_00.html .  5 For some household constellations (especially for households with 3 or more children or three or more adults) this implied a reduction of benefit l evels when compared with benefits according to the earlier 15a treaty.  6 This includes higher benefit levels for specific household constellations and, again for specific household constellations, a higher threshold of assets not to be taken into account concerning eligibility conditions.  7 Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection : https://www.sozialministerium.at/The men/Soziales/Sozialhilfe -und -Mindestsicherung.html . 8 Data for 2020; source: Statistik Austria: https://www.statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=073976  & own calculations.   9 Source: Statistik Austria: https://www.statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=068819 . 10 For details see: https://www.ams.at/regionen/oberoesterreich/news/2020/09/Einmalzahlung  , https://www.ams.at/regionen/wien/news/2020/12/die -oesterreichische -bundesregierung -unterstuetzt -arbeitsuchende  , and https://www.ams.at/regionen/wien/news/2021/12/die -oesterreichische -bundesregierung -unterstuetzt -arbeitsuchende   Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  4  households receiving MMI/SA have been given further  financial support a ccording to a new Act, the “COVID -19-Act against poverty ” (one -off payments up to 300 Euro for households with children;  one -off payment up to 100 Euros as a fuel and heating benefit for all households receiving MMI/SA on a certain key date). This law provides the legal foundation fo r further subsidies in 2022, which will be paid out to cope with increased  cost of living, includi ng higher heating costs (300 Euro per household  paid out by the Federal Provinces ; “Teuerungsausgleich für Haushalte im Sozialhilfe - bzw. Mindestsicherungsbez ug”). 1.1  Eligibility  As a basic principle, claimants are only eligible for MMI /SA if they are neither able to raise the resources for basic subsistence through “own efforts” (work, use of own income, assets and property), nor through entitlements to social i nsurance or other priority benefits (principle of subsidiarity). The point of reference for “own” income is the common household , plus  other people  who  are liable for maintenance.  Regarding income, defined maximum benefits at the same time serve as income thresholds , as means -tested benefit calculation follows a “Euro per Euro principle”. This means that (with some exceptions, see Section 2 below) one additional Euro of other income reduces the total benefit by one Euro. Once other income surpasses the maxi mum benefit level, no MMI/SA  can be granted.  To define the maximum benefit level, the “ equalisation supplement reference rate” (ESRR; Ausgleichszulagenrichtsatz ) for pensions is usually used.11  Besides the pension scheme, the ESRR is also used as a point of reference in other social protection schemes. In 2021, the monthly net ESRR for a single person amount ed €949.5 0.12 According to the Basic Social Assistance Act, income/benefits in 2021 could generally not surpass:   €949.5 0 for single adults (100% of the monthly net ESRR) ;  €1,329.2 0 for a household with two adults (70% of the net ESRR for each adult person) ; and   €427.3 0 for every additional adult in the household (45% of the net ESRR for each ad ditional adult, i.e. from the third adult).  Furthermore, the Basic Social Assistance Act at the same time stipulates that the total benefits granted to adults living in a common household must not exceed 175% of the net ESRR, which equalled €1,661.50 in 20 21. However, irrespective of this general rule, legislators in the federal provinces are allowed to stipulate a monthly minimum benefit of €190 (20% of the ESRR) for each adult in a household, even in cases where this implies that the 175% threshold is exc eeded.  The threshold/benefit level is  further increased for dependent children in the household. However , the maximum benefit levels originally stipulated for children living in households with more than one parent were  abolished by a decision of the Const itutional Court ( of 12 December 2019), on the grounds  that the y violated Article 7 of the Federal Constitutional Law ( Bundesverfassungsgesetz ), which deals with the  11 The ESRR defines the minimum pension for people  who (according to their insurance record, age etc.) are in principle eligible for a pension benefit from the statutory pension scheme, but for whom the insurance record together with the benefit formula would result in a very low pension benefit , i.e. of a level lower than the ESRR. The ESRR regularly gets indexed according to the consumer price inflation. However, in recent years, the ESRR was repeatedly increased at a higher level due to political decision  12 In 2021, the monthly gross ESRR for a single p erson amounts to €1,000.48, on which a health insurance contribution of 5.1% applies. This results on a monthly net ESRR of €949.50. It should be noted that the minimum pension according to the ESRR is granted 14 times per year, i.e. with two monthly extra  payments. However, regarding MMI/SA no such extra payments or corresponding increased income thresholds exist  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  5  “principle of equality” ( Gleichheitsgrundsatz ), and also Article 1 on the rights of childre n.13 As a consequence, no common threshold/maximum benefits are currently defined at  the national level , and federal provinces apply their own  rules  – between which there are  some substantial differences.  For example, in Lower Austria the minimum benefits/ amounts taken into account for the income thresholds for children in households with more than one parent are as follows :14  €237.37 (25% of the ESRR) in the case of one child;   €190 (20% of the ESRR) per child in the case of two children;   €142.40 (15% of the ESRR) per child in the case of three children;   €118.70 (12.5% of the ESRR) per child in the case of four children; and   €114 (12% of the ESRR) per child in the case of five or more children.  When compared with Lower Austria, Vienna has much more generous rules regarding children when setting the maximum benefit/income threshold. Here, the amount taken into account is €256. 40 (27% of the ESRR) per month  for every child .  The income thresholds /  maximum benefit levels for adults mentioned above have been implemented by most federal provinces, but not by Vienna, where most recipients of MMI/SA  live. Vienna grants 100% of the ESRR for single adults, and 75% of the ESRR for adults living in common ho useholds with other adults (no matter how many adults live in the household). Also, the cap on benefits to adults (usually 175% of the ESRR ) does not apply in Vienna. This means that the federal province of Vienna has refused to implement the related maxim um standards stipulated by the Basic Social Assistance Act and grants more generous benefits than foreseen by it.15 For means -testing (Vermögensfreibetrag ) against income, most types of income are taken into account, including benefits from different stran ds of social protection. However, some exceptions exist, of which the most important are as follow s. Social protection benefits: family allowance ( Familienbeihilfe ); long -term care cash benefit ( Pflegegeld ); and child tax credit ( Kinderabsetzbetrag ). Priva te financial transfers: voluntary welfare transfers from charitable organisations , or other benefits from third parties that are provided without any legal obligation, unless the y have already been granted for an uninterrupted period of four months or are so high that social assistance benefits are no longer required.  Besides income, assets  are also taken into account in means -testing for MMI /SA.  Many types of movable assets, which are capable of being capitalised, are included in the means test. However, the following personal objects are generally not seen as assets to be utilised/capitalised: objects necessary to carry out an occupation or to satisfy intellectual/ cultural needs; essential household items; a car if it is needed due to one’s occupation or  disability or if no sufficient public transport infrastructure exists. Besides these exceptions, according to the Basic Social Assistance Act, financial assets (savings) of up to €5,697 (600% of the monthly net ESRR) per person are excluded from means -testing.16  13 For  the full text of t he decision by the Constitutional Court see: https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Vfgh/JFT_20191212_19G00164_00/JFT_20191212_19G00164_00.html . 14 For children of single parents somewhat higher maximum benefits/income thresholds apply. For details see: https://www.noe.gv.at/noe/Sozialhilfe/Richtsaetze_Sozialhilfe.htm l.  15 This could theoretically be brought before the Constitutional Court by the Federal Government, initiating a requ est to repeal the Vienna Minimum Income Act. However, no such steps have been taken hitherto.  16 This means that  savings  etc.  above th is threshold have to be used for subsistence and housing costs before MMI/SA may be granted.  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  6  In addition, owner -occupied dwellings are considered as own resources (assets), to be taken into account  in means -testing. MMI/SA authorities can register a lien within the land registry in favour of the federal province in cases where MMI/SA has been granted for three years or longer.  Besides means -testing against income and assets, rules on residency  and citizenship  apply. EU/EEA citizens can only get MMI/SA if they are employed or if they have been living in Austria for a minimum of five years. Citizens of other countries normally must have had legal residence in Austria for at least five years. Unlike  recogn ised refugees, since the introduction of the Basic Social Assistance Act, people with subsidiary protection status are generally stipulated to be excluded from access to full MMI/SA . Usually, they are only able to receive SA at a level equivalent to “basic supply” ( Grundversorgung ), which is also granted to asylum -seekers. However, the federal province  of Vienna  is again more generous than other federal provinces. Here, people with subsidiary protection status livin g in  a private dwelling can get MMI  up to the usual benefit level.  UA may be granted if a person continues to be unemployed after reaching the maximum benefit duration of UB and if at the same time a "hardship" situation ("Notlage ") applies. However, there is no general definition of hardship ( i.e. in the sense of a common threshold). What is important in this context is that, first, personal earned income from employment (as for UB) may not surpass the “marginal earnings threshold” ( Geringfügigkeitsgrenze ) for social insurance (€475.86 gross pe r month in 2021). Once earned income from employment exceeds this threshold, the person concerned may no longer be defined as unemployed, and neither UB nor UA can be received.  Second, for UA (unlike UB) other personal17 income – under paragraph 2(2) of t he Income Tax Act ( Einkomenssteuergesetz ) – is also taken into account when calculating the level of the benefit. In particular this includes capital income and income from rent or leasing.18 All personal income from these sources reduces the benefit level  of UA according to a "Euro for Euro" principle. Once income from these other sources (aggregated with earned income from employment; see above on earned income below the “marginal earnings threshold”) reaches the UA benefit level, no UA is granted.  Overa ll, it is evident that eligibility criteria in terms of means -testing are rather strict for MMI/SA, although it varies between federal provinces. Regarding UA, means -testing is of very minor importance, as UA is in principle an insurance -based benefit, with uniform rules set by national legislation.  1.2  Coverage  At the time of writing, no detailed assessment of the coverage of MMI /SA is available for Austria. However, to get some basic idea one can compare the number of benefit recipients with the number of peo ple at risk of poverty (i.e. relative income poverty) or at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE), by federal province (see Table 1). When using these data to calculate pseudo -coverage rates (the two columns towards the right), substantial difference s become evident between federal provinces. The pseudo -coverage rate for people at risk of poverty or social exclusion  varies between 6.5% in Carinthia and 31% in Vienna; and the rate for people at risk of poverty varies between 7.7% in Carinthia and 39.8%  in Vienna. A more detailed analysis of these results would go beyond the scope of this report. However, it can be assumed that the huge variation in the coverage rate is – amongst other things –  17 This means that income of  other household members is not being taken into account.  18 Mandatory maintenance payments ( gesetzlicher Unterhalt ) are only taken into account to the degree that they surpass the “marginal earnings threshold” ( Geringfügigkeitsgrenze ) for social insurance (€475.86 gross per month in 2021).  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  7  caused by differences in housing conditions, where areas wit h a higher share of owner -occupied dwellings tend to have a lower share of recipients of MMI/SA, because of the possibility for MMI/SA authorities to taken a lien under the land registry in favour of the federal province in cases where MMI/SA has been gran ted for three years or longer. Furthermore, social stigmatisation may be higher in rural areas, compounded by the fact that the mayors of municipalities in many federal provinces are consulted during the application process for MMI/SA.

Yearly averages for 2018 -2020 are also used for recipients of MMI /SA.

Estimates of non -take -up of MMI/SA, resulting from microsimulation, are scarce for Austria. According to Fuchs et al . (2019; 2020), non -take -up of MMI/SA was reduced from a national average of 51% in 2009 to 30% in 2015 (more recent estimates are not available). This positive development was caused by a number of changes introduced due to the 15a treaty of 2009 (see above, Section 1), including: the Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  8  introduction of minimum st andards representing a binding benefit level; the provision of health insurance for beneficiaries of MMI/SA in the form of an electronic insurance card; and the fact that applications for minimum income benefit since the reform of 2009/2010 can be made at the district authorities ( Bezirkshauptmannschaften ), providing a higher level of anonymity compared with municipality offices. Remaining non -take -up, according to Fuchs et al . (2019, 6), is especially caused by the fact that there is no effective one -stop -shop for recipients of low unemployment benefits, who could get MMI/SA as a top -up, that stigma (although declining) continues to be substantial, and that administrative processes generally still show considerable room for improvement (for example in terms  of waiting times until a decision is taken, the scope of proofs to be provided, or the quality of information provided by responsible authorities). Action explicitly aimed at improving take -up, for example awareness campaigns, has therefore been taken.  Regarding UA, non -take -up appears to be a non -issue in public debates. Take -up is probably  very high, because UA is an insurance -based benefit, and  means -testing is of only very minor importance (see above Section 1.1), and social stigma appears to be low.  1.3  Adequacy  Table 2 provides data on monthly benefit levels for MMI/SA in Lower Austria and Vienna for different selected household compositions. As family allowance and the child tax credit are universal benefits in Austria, the table also indicates benefit levels including these universal transfers for families with children. These benefit levels can then be compared with the at -risk -of-poverty threshold (60% of median equivalised household income), with the extreme at -risk -of-poverty threshold (40% of media n equivalised household income), and with net monthly minimum wages. Note that there is no statutory minimum wage in Austria. However, more than 95% of private sector employees are covered by a minimum wage set within a collective agreement. The lowest min imum wage according to collective agreements amounted to around €1,522 gross per month in 2021. Note that although wages are paid 14 times per year in Austria, the figures in Table 2 represent net yearly wages divided by 12 (months). In the case of couples , it has been assumed that both people are employed full time and that both earn the minimum wage. Wages are indicated with and without universal family allowance and child tax credit. Overall, benefits show somewhat higher generosity in Vienna than in Low er Austria, and these differences would even be greater in households with more than two children (see above Section 1.1). Furthermore, it is evident that benefits (including universal family allowance and child tax credit) are around the level of the extr eme at -risk -of-poverty threshold (40% of the median of equivalised household income), but considerably lower than the other two benchmarks.

Statistik Austria (2020)19 provides an overview of the more concrete living conditions of households receiving MMI/SA. Using average data from the EU -SILC20 waves 201 7-201 9, the analysis shows that 4 7% of people living in households with MMI/SA were at risk of poverty (income below the 60% of the median threshold), whereas the figure for people in households withou t MMI was 13%.  Furthermore, no less than 2 4% of the population in MMI/SA households faced severe material deprivation (enforced inability to pay for at least four out of nine items), whereas the figure was 2% for people living in households without MMI/SA  benefits. The following deprivation items, in particular, showed comparatively high numbers for people in households with MMI/SA.  Inability to face unexpected expenses: 53% in households without children and 81% in households with children (in households  without MMI/SA: without children, 1 6%; with children, 19%).  Inability to pay rent, mortgage or utility bills etc on time: 8% in households without children and 9% in households with children (in households without MMI/SA: without children, 1%; with children, 2%).   19 For data dealing with 2015 -2017 see Statistik Austria (2018a; 2018b) . 20 European Union statistics on income and living conditions .

Inability to afford a car: 29% in households without children and 51% in households with children (in households without MMI/SA: without children, 4%; with children, 4%).

As noted in Section 1.1, maximum levels of MMI/SA are set by using the ESRR of the statutory pension scheme, and then multiplying the ESRR by a weight according to household composition. As already mentioned, the weight given to different household members (especially children ) varies between federal provinces, resulting in different benefit levels. Besides that, it is important to know that the ESRR is not in any sense evidence -based (for example, calculated according to a basket of goods or model household budgets). In fact i t derives from a political decision in 1955, and has since then been indexed and adapted – but in a largely path -dependent manner.  However, on the positive side, levels of MMI/SA are usually indexed on a yearly basis, together with the ESRR. Furthermore, t he ESRR in recent years has been repeatedly increased by more than prices. Both pensioners and recipients of MMI/SA have benefited from that.  UA is – in principle – calculated as a fraction of UB, which it replaces once the maximum duration of UB is reache d. UB is calculated as follows:  the “basic amount” ( Grundbetrag ): 55% of the early daily net income from employment;  plus “supplementary amount” ( Ergänzungsbeitrag ): where the monthly benefit resulting from the basic amount is lower than the gross ESRR (i. e. €1,000.48; see above), it may be increased up to the level of the gross ESRR (but see condition below);  plus “family supplements” ( Familien -Zuschlag ): for every dependent family member, a family supplement of €0.97 per day may apply (value for 2021) (bu t see condition below).  Points 2 and point 3 above are subject to the following conditions: in cases where no family supplements apply, the total daily net wage -replacement rate may not exceed 60%; in cases where family supplements apply, it may not exceed  80%.  UA generally amounts to 92% of the basic amount of UB , if the basic amount surpasses the ESRR. If it is lower than the ESRR, UA amounts to 95% of the basic amount of the UB, , plus 95% of the supplementary amount plus any family supplements . At the s ame time, special benefit caps may apply for UA. They depend on the benefit duration of the preceding UB, whereby the benefit duration of UB varies according to the earlier insurance record. UB is usually granted for 20 weeks. However, the maximum duration  may be extended according to the following rules:  to 30 weeks in the case of 156 weeks (three years) of employment subject to unemployment insurance;  to 39 weeks if the beneficiary is aged at least 40 and has 312 weeks (six years) of employment subject to unemployment insurance within the previous 10 years; and  Exploratory study: filling in the knowledge gaps and identifying strengths and challenges in the effectiveness of the EU Member States’ minimum income schemes   February, 2022  12  to 52 weeks if the beneficiary is at least 50 and has 468 weeks (nine years) of employment subject to unemployment insurance within the previous 15 years.  In cases where the preceding maximum bene fit duration of UB was 20 weeks, for subsequent UA a cap of €1,000.48 (i.e. at the level of the gross ESRR) per month applies. In cases where the maximum duration for UB is 30 weeks, UA is capped at €1,167 per month (116.6% of the gross ESRR).21 In cases w here UB was obtained for 39 or 52 weeks, no such benefit cap applies for UA.  Overall, these rules (i.e. a largely uniform wage -replacement rate, which only changes to a small degree according to the earlier earned income, and the benefit caps on UA) often tend to imply rather low benefits from UA. Furthermore, UA (different to MMI/SA) is not indexed, which causes a devaluation of the benefit in cases of long -term unemployment. As a consequence, a substantial number of UA recipients get MMI/SA as a top -up to  low benefits from unemployment insurance.  According to data compiled by Statistics Austria,22 207,122 people received MMI/SA in 2020 (for more details see also Pratscher 2021). Of these, 14,112 (6.8%) were employed and received minimum income as a top -up to low earned income; and 63,952 (30.9%) were unemployed and available for employment.23 Of this latter group, 36,092 people (56%) got MMI/SA as a top -up to low benefits from unemployment insurance. This number equals a share of around 10% of all recipient s of UB and UA (totalling 362,160 in 202024).     21 This is the „minimum s ubsistence level” ( Existenzminimum ) according to the Austrian En forcement Regulation ( Exekutionsordnung ). It is equal to the ESSR, increased by 1/6 of the ESRR.  22 Statistik Austria, https://www.statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=068824 . 23 In total 108,399 (52.3%) were not available for employment due to different reasons: 34.3% were not in employment age; 7.8% were incapable to work due to health issues / invalidity / disability; 4 .3% were pupils who had started their school education before the age of 18; 4.3% were looking after children; 0.3% were looking after relatives in need of long -term care; 1.3% were not available for employment due to other reasons.  24 Statistik Austria, https://www.statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=020064 .

Additionally, recipients of UA are also covered by pension insurance.   In some federal provinces, recipients of MMI/SA  or of UA have access to additional housing benefit (“rent support”) in case s of high ho using costs.   In most federal provinces , a specific means -tested allowance for heating costs exists for low -income households. To get the heating costs allowance, potential beneficiaries have to apply for it via the municipality, and the related regulations  concerning means -testing and the level of the benefit vary between the different federal provinces. The benefit varies between around €110 per year in Carinthia25 and €270 per year in Vorarlberg.26 Regarding means -testing, low income for single adults is usually defined as an income at , or somewhat above, the level of the monthly  net ESRR, and household composition is taken into account.  2
