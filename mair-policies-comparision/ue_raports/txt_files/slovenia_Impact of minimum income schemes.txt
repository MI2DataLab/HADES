Impact of MI schemes  The only other study on the impact of MI schemes on the risk of poverty was the Court of Audit13 report on the effectiveness of public social spending in reducing poverty in t he period 2017 -2020 (Court of Audit, 2021) .14 The report found that the government and the MLFSAEO were partly successful in reducing poverty between 2017 and 2020. The targets for reducing the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion (AROP E) were achieved. Social transfers performed well in reducing the risk of child poverty, but the situation has not improved for single -parent families. The MLFSAEO did not monitor and analyse the use of funds earmarked for poverty reduction, nor did it ide ntify and analyse the impact of social transfers paid from its funds on the AROP indicators.  Section 2 provided an overview of assessments of the impact of labour market activation services on employment prospects, but these do not distinguish the MI benef iciaries in particular. Reducing poverty is a political priority in Slovenia, which is evident from national strategic documents such as the Slovenian Development Strategy 2030 (GRS, 2017) where ‘People at Risk of Social Exclusion’ is one of six performanc e indicators, and the draft Resolution on the National Social Assistance Programme 2021 -2030 (2021), which sets out a reduction in the risk of poverty and social exclusion as a key social policy aim in the coming decade.    12 Information collected through consultation  with  Sanja Belec , ESS, on 21 October 2021.  13 The Court of Audit is the highest body for supervising State accounts, the State budget and all public spending . 14 Report on the implementation of the National Social Assistance Programme 2013 -2020.
